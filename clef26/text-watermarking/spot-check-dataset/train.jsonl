While it is not perfect, it is still revolutionary. Why is that so? First of all, it breaks with the paradigm of inevitability, and it puts democracy over private, monopolistic interests, because until now there was a feeling that big tech was too powerful to regulate, and now we make it clear that democracies set the rules. Secondly, it makes the Internet a better place without interfering with freedom of expression. The DSA holds platforms accountable for what they do and not for what their users think or write in their posts. And finally, it tackles the information asymmetry. Today, platforms know everything about us because they collect our data. But the little we know, we learned from whistle-blowers, like Frances Haugen. And this is why the risk assessment and the access to the data of the platforms for independent researchers, also from civil society organisations, is so important because they will provide us with the evidence we need to regulate well. And they will be able to tell the stories about how social networks influence our public opinion, our politics, or the health of our children. Europe and the world deserve a free Internet where democracy counts more than private profits. The DSA is a first, but giant, step in that direction."}

Last week’s anti-Western pro-Russian demonstrations took place on the streets of Chișinău, with the majority of the demonstrators shipped to the capital by buses. I hope Moldovan law enforcement agents will determine how much it was a genuine expression of the anger about the economic situation and how much it was a deliberate campaign by Russia to destabilise the situation in the country. But one thing is clear: if in the future we want a peaceful and prosperous Europe, then the EU and our Western partners need to get more involved in Moldova now. We need to provide greater support to the Moldovan people to deal with the economic hardship induced by Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine. We need to provide human expertise and, if necessary, military resources to give Moldova a means to defend its sovereignty and its pro-European path. And we need to confirm that Moldova is welcome to join the EU as soon as it fulfils the accession criteria. And we should be ready to start accession negotiations with Moldova this year."}

This morning, President Barroso proposed an interinstitutional agreement on a growth initiative to properly involve the European Parliament in the process. My first point is about democracy. I welcome President Barroso’s proposal, but I would also like to recall that two years ago, this Parliament voted for something much more important: an interinstitutional agreement on the European Semester. We must make the European Semester process truly democratic. Commissioner Rehn, you reminded our Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on Monday that the new economic dialogue provision in the ‘six-pack’ expects the Council, as a general rule, to follow the recommendations and proposals of the Commission. Those recommendations cover essential elements of national policy: labour market regulation, pension systems, collective bargaining practices and so on. It is simply not acceptable that such recommendations are meant to be followed by Member States without the proper democratic involvement of both national and European Parliaments. That democratic deficit needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. My second point concerns the economic situation. Today, we have voted on the so-called ‘two-pack’, but we have still not made any progress in recognising the importance of public investment as a key part of national budgetary policies. Public investment is now to be increasingly addressed, as you have said, through European instruments, for example, through an increased role for the EIB and the pilot project on project bonds. But these instruments will not be enough to solve the growing public investment deficit across the Member States. Public investment is at least 1% of GDP too low now, and that will not be made up via these instruments. The Commission needs to provide solid estimates of public investment needs between now and 2020, taking account of existing policy objectives. It then needs to indicate as precisely as possible how those needs are to be met. Only then will we be able to assess whether the proposed instrument will address the public investment deficit or whether, as we believe, we need to go further. We believe that we need to address that deficit systematically within the rules on economic governance through a new growth regulation. Only in that way will we find a sensible balance between austerity and growth."}

The legitimate National Assembly and subsequently the Supreme Court having been neutered, 20 May is merely a coronation in a race devoid of any legitimate opposition. The collapse of the Santo Domingo talks made clear Maduro’s intentions to avoid any real challenge to his power now, as was also demonstrated by the banning of virtually all opposition parties from these elections. I welcome the targeted EU sanctions brought in by the Council against some Venezuelan officials. However, these remain limited, and we must now look to widen their scope. As the energy sector, which accounts for around 90% of Venezuela’s exports, begins to shrink, we see food shortages continuing and domestic dissatisfaction growing. Reports that the Government is looking to open up commercial opportunities for the military are also a worrying sign for the future, suggesting that Maduro intends to follow what was in the past an all too common Latin American authoritarian tactic for holding on to power via the army. I fear that these elections may be the first in a long line of staged elections made all the easier by the 2009 constitutional amendments to abolish term limits. I am pleased that at least we will be on record today in this House as having made our condemnatory position very clear to everybody."}

More than that, it was plain wrong. Much has been said about what this failure could mean to the EU’s credibility, not just in those two aspirant countries but far beyond, and how it could destabilise the whole region. What makes it particularly shameful is the fact that the refusal to open talks was motivated by domestic political consideration or, to put it more directly, by poll figures in a certain EU Member State. It was not the result of any failure by the aspirants to live up to their end of the bargain. In fact, quite the opposite was the case. The leaders of North Macedonia especially have displayed admirable courage and taken significant political risks to resolve a longstanding disagreement with a neighbour. I believe the Council decision from last week runs counter to the vision of Europe whole and free. It is crucial that the mistake be corrected before irreparable damage is done to our credibility and to our common European security interest."}

I would just like to add two thoughts on this matter. The first is that, despite all the concern and fear being felt by the people, we must not lose sight of the principles. The two principles that define Europe are solidarity – we stand by this – and a sense of individual responsibility – that the Greek people and all those who receive acts of solidarity also take responsibility themselves. The second thought is that mention has been made of the big test for Europe and of the concern that the project could perhaps even fail and that old ghosts that we had thought we had eradicated could return to the European Union. I would like to turn all of this around and look at it in a positive light. We should not just talk about the problems, but also about the successes. For example, we should mention that some of the Baltic States have managed to overcome the crisis and that, with European support, Ireland will succeed in returning to the bond markets next year. This could also be a big opportunity to prove to the people that we are stronger together than we are alone. In this context, it is quite difficult to deal with the second major issue for the Council meeting, namely that of migration. However, there is a nice link that connects the two issues, because in relation to the migration issue, in particular Schengen, we also see the same principle at work, namely that one of Europe’s major successes is now being called into question as a result of national egotism. I am sure that we have all seen the figures indicating that 18 000 refugees have arrived in Italy. However, we all know that, for Italy, 18 000 refugees is hardly an excessive burden, because twice as many refugees have been received in the last year in Belgium alone. It was therefore not right of Italy to react in the way that it did. It was internal policymaking by Italy’s minister of reforms, Umberto Bossi. On account of a few hundred people, France responded by reintroducing border controls, and that, too, was for domestic political reasons. In Denmark, too, the reasons were of an internal political nature. I would therefore like clear signals to be sent out from the Council meeting. When the question of migration and Schengen is discussed, the Heads of State or Government of the European Union must respond with the clear message that we do not want national egotism, in particular in this area. Instead we want to defend the huge success that is a free Europe. Mr Barroso, you will certainly have Parliament’s support in that."}

The European statistical programme ensures just that, by providing trusted statistics on Europe through Eurostat, the statistical authority of the Union. The evidence provided by the European statistical programme underpins all of the political priorities of the Union. As priorities change and in order to address new challenges, the statistical programme now needs to be adapted to remain relevant and to provide the information needed to take informed decisions for the future of Europe. The Commission welcomes the compromise achieved between the three institutions on the extension of the current European statistical programme to 2020. The compromise addresses the growing demand for relevant and timely statistics to support the key Union priorities. In particular, the extension of the programme contains measures for the production of new and better statistics in support of a more social Europe. For example, it will provide better data on income and inequalities, as well as equal opportunities on the labour market. Furthermore, the integration of migrants into the labour market will be better monitored. The programme will also deliver more detailed and faster statistics for other important policy areas such as the Energy Union and will support the monitoring of the Sustainable Development Goals at Union level. The Commission considers this extension of the programme to 2020 to be a most important step forward in further strengthening the European Statistical System’s capacity to deliver more timely data and to better respond to policy needs. The foreseen enhanced budgetary support is urgently needed for these developments. I am grateful that Parliament has been a most active and cooperative ally by providing political guidance and support in this regard. The Commission looks forward to pursuing this positive development for European statistics in the coming years and in particular in relation to the evolution of EU governance in many policy domains and in preparing the future multiannual financial framework (MFF). I wish to conclude by thanking the rapporteur Mr Roberto Gualtieri – thank you so much – and the shadow rapporteurs of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for their constructive approach to the proposal. I also wish to thank Ms Maria Arena and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for their much appreciated opinion. I believe we have reached the common objective to ensure that European policymakers and citizens can continue to rely on the valuable facts provided by the European statistical programme."}

The newly created rules require EU embassies and representations to take fingerprints and photos of applicants in future. This meets four objectives. Firstly, it will simplify the process of combating fraud and abuse, as biometric identifiers make forging visas more difficult. Secondly, it will prevent so-called visa shopping. Thirdly, the process of applying for a visa will be speeded up. Fourthly, at the same time border controls will be made easier, because biometric identifiers will allow border staff to determine quickly whether the person in front of them is the person for whom the visa was issued. We would have been happy to support the Commission proposal to take the fingerprints of children from the age of six years upwards, in order to prevent the risk of people trafficking. Unfortunately there was not a majority in favour of this in the House. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports with a broad majority the compromise that a Member State which is responsible for accepting and processing applications must also be able as a last resort to work with external service providers. A decisive factor in our agreement to cooperation of this kind is that the Member States remain responsible for data protection and data security in these cases. This means that the electronic data sent by the external service providers to the authorities of the relevant Member State must always be fully encrypted. I would like to thank the rapporteur and my fellow Members from the other groups, who have worked as shadow rapporteurs on this project for three years."}

The current situation shows that we cannot let things run their own course and there is a need for regulation. ‘Regulation’ does not mean bureaucracy – certainly not excessive bureaucracy – but assurance that things are being done in the best possible way, and not by means of formulas and papers that lead nowhere. When my fellow Members and I prepared this report we had two priorities. Firstly, to ensure that any changes that take place do not have negative repercussions for the consumer. In other words, there should be no additional burdens on the consumer, and that is why we are saying that the possibility of introducing VAT on financial services should apply only to transactions between one business and another and should therefore be recoverable. At no stage should our text propose that VAT on a financial service that is not taxable be passed on to an individual – that is, the consumer. This is stated clearly and directly in the proposed text, despite possible reservations on the part of other institutions. Some people criticise the fact that the industry will save on expenses and that Member States’ income may be reduced – an interesting argument which, however, quite frankly I think comes most of the time from those with a restricted view of the economy and fiscal policy. Firstly, in a competitive sector like that of financial services and in a system where you have safeguards against agreements between companies, any expenses not incurred by companies should either be passed on as benefits to the consumer or else be used to compensate for other existent expenses. Secondly, as Europe we should understand once and for all that we are not competing alone on the market; we have to ensure that the systems used by other Member States – and by the European Union as a whole – are attractive to serious companies wishing to enter the market and establish themselves as true European operators. Facilitating the systems is a way of offering an incentive in this sector, generating market potential and creating work, productive work. Through this report we are helping to create a European market by removing obstacles. We are doing what has been talked about for many years; we are fulfilling one of the aims of the action plan in this sector. We are proving that we can be proactive, solve problems and act on new ideas. Perhaps we may disagree on technicalities, perhaps some may say that we can use one system and not another, but I believe that this Parliament must give an indication that this is our ultimate aim. Obviously there are certain points on which we are not all agreed, myself included: for example, broadening the definitions. I believe that it would have been better if the committee had followed my recommendations on this, which were always either to keep to the Commission’s text, or else to further restrict the definitions. In spite of this, we should also note that the committee chose to proceed strategically, and so this report was approved with just one vote against. I await the reactions of my friends as well as those of the Commission."}

Let me briefly say a few words on both of them. The main purpose of the Commission proposal regarding the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization is to implement into EU law the most recent conservation and enforcement measures adopted by this organisation at its annual meeting in September 2021. As you know, such transposition of updated measures by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization is a regular legislative exercise. However, in addition, this Commission proposal includes delegated powers to the Commission concerning landing and inspection for Greenland halibut, as well as the control measures for cod in Division 3M. Such delegated powers are important in order to ensure a fast transposition into EU law of these technical rules that change every year. The adoption of this amending regulation will allow Union vessels to fish on the same footing as vessels from other contracting parties of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation for future fishing seasons. This has been a recurrent request from many stakeholders across the EU, and I would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for their full support for the Commission proposal. As regards the Commission proposal for a regulation for the Union Fleet operating in the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission Convention area, I believe that overall the amendments by the co-legislators improved the text. At the same time, those amendments are indeed in line with the organisation’s conservation and management measures. However, I regret that the co-legislators missed the opportunity to simplify the overall process of transposition, since some of the avenues proposed by the Commission to streamline the process were not supported by the co—legislators, despite Parliament’s and Council’s earlier calls on the Commission to further improve the process. I obviously fully respect your positions, but I think we missed a good opportunity here to simplify the procedures, which are currently too complex and long. The transposition process lasts on average 18 months – from the drafting of the proposal by the Commission to its adoption by the co-legislators. Considering the nature of this exercise, this is far too long and complicated. I would therefore like to ask for the inclusion of a statement on behalf of the Commission in the minutes of this debate reflecting our disappointment. The Commission will, in any case, continue to work together with the European Parliament and the Council on further improvements to the implementation of the process. In this particular context, I would like to point to the two Commission proposals for the transposition of international fisheries conservation measures which are currently stalled in the interinstitutional negotiations. One proposal concerns the conservation of the Atlantic bluefin tuna management plan, and the other the Atlantic bluefin tuna catch documentation scheme. I am concerned that such delays affect the credibility of the European Union in the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas. It is indeed difficult to explain to our international partners why it takes so long for the EU to implement its international obligations. I am also concerned that the lack of transposition has negative consequences for the EU fishing fleet. We should really avoid this. We trust that work will pick up in light of the most recent additional amendment proposed by the Commission in April this year and, of course, I look forward to seeing these two files advanced quickly."}

The specifications and selection criteria which will be allowed in the calls for tender have also been broadened and explicitly allow for the inclusion of social goals. Public authorities will no longer be forced to sign up for the cheapest tender, even when it fails to deliver minimum quality standards. ‘Penny wise, pound foolish’ approaches often end up costing the public more in the long-term, especially when the lack of quality also undermines other public policy goals. Our citizens are entitled to expect quality and value for their tax money. Where possible, authorities will now divide contracts into smaller lots, which will open up public procurement markets, which until now were out of reach of many small and medium-sized enterprises due to their scale. Provision by public bodies and cooperation between public authorities have been safeguarded from the requirements imposed on market operators.

If some companies had their way, it would be possible to drive without any time restrictions, during the day, at night, during weekends and on bank holidays. This type of driving would benefit this industry which, in permanent competition with the railways and internal shipping, tries to be the fastest and the cheapest. HGV drivers who are employees are pleased about driving-time restrictions, which aim to protect their own health, but not about compulsory waiting at uncomfortable locations. Self-employed drivers, who are often former employees who, under pressure from their managers, have had to take over the business risk, want to drive without any time restrictions in order to be able to keep their heads above water financially. If, on the other hand, it were up to the residents in the vicinity of through roads, HGV traffic in Europe would be kept to an absolute minimum, and it would certainly not pass through built-up areas, areas of outstanding natural beauty, mountain valleys and mountain passes. Local authorities welcome HGV traffic only to the private industrial sites, because these generate employment and income, and not through traffic, which only generates inconvenience. There is now a plethora of measures by means of which local authorities and regions protect the environment and their Sunday rest, and try to level out dangerous peaks in traffic. For a large majority of people, it is important for this freedom to be retained without facing unnecessary barriers to cross borders. Mr Savary’s proposals make the bans on TEN routes predictable. However, I would prefer to see the fast transport of perishable agricultural products, to which he gives due consideration, transferred to the railways, and for that reason, I do not endorse his proposal for a derogation.

There are two aspects to this issue; firstly, obstacles preventing researchers and teachers and others from moving around at present. A High Level Working Group met with experts from all the Member States and submitted a report to us, which will also be discussed at the Research Council on 26 June, and will be communicated to Parliament to present all the difficulties regarding mobility encountered by the scientific community. As I often say, it is more difficult for a researcher who has qualified in Europe to go to another European country than to go, for instance, to the United States. There are, therefore, obstacles that we must try to face and to remove. The second aspect to this issue concerns the mobility of young researchers. You are aware that we have the Marie Curie programme, which is a success, but we would like to double the resources in the proposals allocated to assisting the mobility of young researchers, and also to create grants to attract researchers to Europe, so that Europe once again becomes an attractive option for the best researchers in the world including third countries. You will see that there are very specific proposals on the issues of mobility in the programme. Lastly, I believe that my final point, which is the problem of how to put into practice the elements of sustainable development, is included in the policy that Parliament, the Commission and the Council will discuss at Gothenburg. I believe that there is research to be done in these areas, particularly on the specific examples, in order to support the policies of sustainable development. Furthermore, Mr Piétrasanta, you have put forward the idea of having some specific ecosites, for example, in a specific area, which, I believe, is a good example of how sustainable development can be achieved on a local level and I think that creating a network of ecosites is something that is feasible in Europe."}

It is ten years since the Rotterdam Convention was signed, and it was said then that prior written approval should be sought for the export of dangerous chemicals. After all we are not dealing with just any chemicals; the list of chemicals contains the most hazardous chemicals used by man on earth today. So it has taken ten years. One reason for that is the stubborn attitude of the old Commission which insisted that it was just a commercial matter. I thank Stavros Dimas for ensuring that we now have an appropriate legal basis and can take things forward. Nor was it always easy to negotiate with the Council. I was shocked when the Presidency thought that lethal chemicals, which are in practice banned in the EU, could be exported to other countries over long periods without prior consent. The reason for this was that the Council did not want European industry to be at a competitive disadvantage. The real competitive disadvantage to our industry, however, would arise if it were forced to jeopardise health, the environment and international law in order to survive. It is absurd to claim that we have to breach international conventions just because others do not comply with rules and standards. You might as well say that the EU should export illegal drugs because, if it does not, the Mafia will. I am glad that we were able to agree in the end and finally plug the loophole for non-approved exports. We now have legislation which does not just cover Convention chemicals but also contains requirements for other chemicals which are strictly controlled in the EU. These must now be assessed against health and environmental criteria by the appropriate authorities prior to export. It is good that the period for exemptions has been shortened from 36 to 12 months. It is also good that chemicals contained in products are covered. Finally we have legislation which is acceptable and improves on the Commission’s proposal but could have been even better if public health and the environment had taken precedence over corporate interests; that is after all the only sustainable economic model."}

Their talent, skills and ideas will shape Europe’s future. At the same time, our global economy is characterised by uncertainty and unprecedented fast changes. Helping young people gain a foothold in the rapidly evolving labour markets therefore remains a priority for this Commission. We have delivered a reinforced Youth Guarantee, a modernised European framework for vocational education and training and a new impetus for apprenticeships. Together with Parliament, we put the social dimension at the heart of the European Year of Youth and the ongoing European Year of Skills. The Commission is committed to continuing to strengthen bridges that bring young people to the labour market, notably by exploiting the potential of hands-on, work-based learning. Traineeships are an important pathway for young people to access the labour market. Traineeships can provide a unique opportunity to learn on the job and to practically prepare for the world of work. They help improve their skills and increase their employability, and we see that trainees increasingly find traineeships in another Member States. So, I’m really a bit shocked when some people talk about the cost of traineeships. The cost of traineeships. What an absurd approach to what should be considered to be the benefit of traineeships. Because the benefit of traineeships is not just about trainees; it’s not just about young people. It’s also about companies. Those who benefit from traineeships are also intelligent companies who give young people an opportunity and profit and take use of their knowledge, of their commitment and also of their sense of innovation. These are contributions to companies who benefit from these young people. That’s why traineeships have to be paid. They should not be just for free. It’s a way to recognise the contribution of young people. It’s also a form of respect for young people. That’s why also, I’m sure, many companies pay and those who do not pay should change their behaviour. Therefore, this Parliament has rightly stressed, by an overwhelming majority, that traineeships must be of quality and come with fair working conditions, including pay and a proper learning experience. And they should be accessible to all. This was also a clear call by the Conference on the Future of Europe and youth organisations, and we are heeding this call. Traineeships should not be a means of depriving people of their rights at work, or of replacing regular jobs. We need to combat precarious traineeships, not promote them. The Commission is currently preparing an initiative to update the EU Quality Framework for Traineeships to be presented before the end of this Parliament’s term. We absolutely share the goals set out by Parliament, and we will do our utmost to meet Parliament’s requests while respecting – and we have no choice here – the boundaries set by the Treaties. This will be the Commission’s response to the Parliament’s legislative own-initiative resolution. This will be a strong signal of our common political will to empower young people in a strong social Europe and give them good prospects, instead of trapping them in precariousness."}

However, from a methodological point of view, I honestly do not agree with concluding at first reading a matter that will only become effective from 2014 onwards, and which divests Parliament of the power to exert its full potential on such an important issue. Looking at the substance, I believe that the positive elements in the new regulation are not fully compensated by the persistence of negative issues that adversely affect the interests of industrial sectors that have already been severely tested in Europe by a globalisation governed neither by multilateral rules nor by reciprocity. One positive aspect, however, is the new geographical coverage owing to the principle of differentiation, which provides a boost for the poorest nations. Equally useful is the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance, known as ‘GSP+’, linked to the implementation of the main international conventions on social, human and environmental rights. Also positive is the safeguard clause for the entire textile and clothing sector, as well as the general clause. However, the loosening of the financial criteria for the beneficiaries of the GSP+ regime and the exclusion from the graduation mechanism of nations that come under this scheme actually opens the door to unfair competition in relation to already heavily affected sectors, as I said, and gives priority to countries such as Pakistan, whose violations in the field of human rights must not be approved. In short, there is no doubt that this is a positive regulation, but the issues I mention cast a shadow over other aspects that we wished to consider."}

Since then, we have been treated to four years of drama, witnessing the UK’s painful coming-to-grips with the reality of unwinding decades of membership of the largest single market in the world and, in my humble opinion, the best cooperation project – even with its imperfections – that mankind has so far created. The Global Britain that Brexiteers dangled before the British people is no longer a viable project – if it even ever was – in a newly polarised world, where the institutions that underpin the multilateral order are being hollowed out and where protectionism is growing in the wake of the coronavirus. While the political Brexit happened last January, the economic Brexit still looms large at the end of this year, following the UK’s ideological decision not to extend the transition period. Our message for the ongoing negotiations is crystal clear: the European Parliament stands behind our chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. The UK claims to seek an agreement rooted only in precedent, yet their proposals in areas such as financial services or professional qualifications go well beyond what the EU has ever conceded in any other FTA. The UK refuses to engage with the EU on topics such as public procurement – notwithstanding commitments taken in the Political Declaration – and refuses to speak about SMEs, yet they do so with other negotiating partners, the latest example being the UK’s objectives for negotiations with Australia, published today, and including government procurement and SME chapters. What a surprise! Any agreement without robust guarantees for a level playing field or without an agreement on fisheries simply will not fly. And let’s be clear: a level playing field does not mean a copy/paste of our rules and regulations, but rather that we take our common point of departure as a point of no regression, following which we jointly managefuture divergence to guarantee equivalence, not necessarily identical rules for all players. We stand firmly behind the Commission’s approach to press for a comprehensive agreement. We reject the UK’s piecemeal, sectoral approach as it is well known that salami tactics lead to a cluttered spaghetti-bowl agreement. The implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement remains key and the European Court of Justice must remain the sole referee of EU law. Indeed, the EU is no less sovereign in its decision-making and decision-taking than the UK is. Finally, allow me to thank my co-rapporteur, Kati Piri, for the excellent collaboration we have had in this exercise. I would also like to thank the 17 committees which gave an opinion for their valuable input. I sincerely hope that there will only be one last Brexit resolution: to consent to a balanced agreement no later than November this year. Personally, I remain confident that the legendary British pragmatism will prevail over ideology in the interest of all UK and EU citizens. The unilateral, staged introduction of border controls for EU goods coming into the UK, announced last Friday, to give corona-hit businesses time to adapt seems to indicate that. So let’s use this new momentum very wisely."}

We have had two decades and a little bit more of cohesion payments. They were introduced as part of the Maastricht Treaty, when it was all about bringing the worse-off regions of Europe up to the standard. We are now in a position to see how that has worked. Which country has been the biggest net recipient of cohesion payments under the European Treaties in per capita terms? Greece. Well, how is that working out in terms of improving the Greek economy? There is a reason why there is this link. It is that if you have more money available and being paid out by bureaucracies than you can get in the private sector then, in every cohort of Greek schools, the best and brightest kids will make the rational decision to work for Brussels or in some government agency, rather than making something or selling something. So the European Union becomes a gigantic mechanism for the redistribution of taxpayers’ funds – and we wonder why we are falling further and further behind economically."}

At the same time, we are aware of, and condemn, the severe human rights abuses – including recruitment of child soldiers and widespread sexual violence – taking place in the region. Yet, in this context, it is important to remember that today’s critical situation in North Kivu, while exacerbated by the fighting taking place in the second half of 2007, is a result of years of war in the region. The root causes of the Kivu conflict can be traced all the way to the Rwandan genocide at the beginning of the 1990s, while also bearing in mind that there are several local components – such as insufficient political representation of ethnic minorities, pillaging of natural resources and land tenure issues – that significantly contribute to the instability and insecurity in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. That is why the Commission welcomes the recent Goma Peace Conference and the following cease-fire as positive steps towards solving the enduring conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. The Conference restored President Kabila’s credibility after the army’s defeat against General Nkunda’s troops at the end of 2007, and launched an inter-provincial dialogue process – something that the Commission has always advocated. Moreover, along the lines of the commitments made by the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda in their Nairobi Joint Communiqué in November 2007, the Goma Conference also re-emphasised the need to tackle the problem of the ex-FAR as a priority. At the same time, it was made clear that there is a need to address the root causes of the conflict, while restoring the State authority in the east. That said, it should not be forgotten that nothing was definitively solved at Goma or Nairobi. Finding a permanent solution to the root causes of the Kivu crisis, and thus a sustainable restoration of peace in the region, will take time. Indeed, while complementing each other, the Nairobi Joint Communiqué and the Goma Conference represent an encouraging start – but only a start – of a difficult and lengthy process. The main challenge ahead is now an effective implementation of the Nairobi and Goma commitments. It ought to be assured that all the concerned stakeholders stand by their commitments. The EU will continue to follow closely and participate actively in this process. In this context, international action in support of the Congolese is very much needed. The Commission, together with the Member States, is ready to continue to play an important role in the Kivus. We have traditionally been one of the most important donors in the east, via our humanitarian assistance and our rehabilitation and capacity-building programmes. We are willing to further increase our support for the region, especially through European initiatives, as well as in close collaboration with the United Nations."}

Those of you who are actively involved in this work or are simply interested in it know that it is not a purely formal or symbolic structure, indeed quite the reverse, since the Assembly increasingly functions as a true parliamentary assembly. Its members are increasingly engaged in it, influential figures sound it out and as a result it is acquiring growing political importance. This is the first point that I wanted to emphasise. The growing political importance of this Assembly also derives from the fact that apart from the fundamental issues relating to cooperation between ACP and EU countries, it also discusses issues which are topical both for Europeans and ACP countries. This is the case, for example, with the Economic Partnership Agreements negotiated between the Union and ACP countries. On this issue, the JPA has confirmed with the Kigali Declaration that the leaders concerned clearly want the European Commission to give ACP countries enough time to negotiate regional development agreements. Kigali is not only an opportunity to show that there is real resistance to these agreements, as they currently exist, but also that this resistance is founded on concerns which are entirely legitimate and which must now be properly taken into account. In the same way, it is only through participating in the work of the Assembly that many MPs in ACP countries have learnt of the existence of Country Strategy Papers that define areas of cooperation between the EU and their own countries. This serves as a reminder that, for many MPs in ACP countries, the Assembly is sometimes the only possible forum for democratic expression. I would also like to stress that in 2007 we witnessed the increasing engagement of civil society in ACP countries, with excellent meetings and initiatives being organised on the sidelines of each JPA session. In the fight for development by civil society in ACP countries, the Assembly also represents an extraordinary opportunity for exchange and encounter. In this respect, the Union must be able to support, technically and financially, the presence of these associations and NGOs in the work of the JPA. Finally, I would like to underline that in our report, we encourage the JPA to strengthen the role of its Committee on Political Affairs. The idea behind this is to make it a true forum for conflict prevention and settlement and to encourage close collaboration between the activities of ACP and EU parliamentarians as election observers within the framework of EU election observation. You should also know that in 2007 the Assembly met in Wiesbaden, and then in Kigali. Nine resolutions were adopted. The standing committees met four times: twice on the sidelines of the sessions and twice in between those sessions, in Brussels. These committees, which are in charge of following up the resolutions, have since 2007 organised the hearing of the responsible committee members in the corresponding areas. Apart from several reports, the Wiesbaden session adopted a resolution on the situation in Darfur. There was a very constructive urgent debate on the situation in Zimbabwe. The workshops on immigration, climate change and medicines for neglected diseases all attracted a great number of participants and great interest. The Kigali session adopted three resolutions contained in the reports by the Standing Committees, Committees and two urgent resolutions on natural disasters in the ACP countries and the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Mr President, Commissioner, there you have it. I have briefly summarised a formal report that I wanted to give a political content, in order to help explain and more effectively support the work of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly."}

This is because several Member States may claim taxing rights on the same inheritance or may tax foreign inheritances more heavily than local inheritances. As a result, citizens may be forced to sell inherited assets just to cover the taxes, and small businesses may face transfer difficulties on the death of their owners. Inheritance tax can therefore give rise to obstacles that deter Europeans from exercising their rights across borders within the European Union. Discriminatory taxation can also become an artificial disincentive to further investment across the single market in otherwise viable businesses. Because of the fear of leaving huge inheritance tax and legal bills for their family members, business owners may consider investment-reducing alternatives such as liquidation, down-sizing or retirement from their cross-border investments. This is because they may not see the value in maintaining such highly taxable investments. It was to tackle these problems that, on 15 December 2011, the Commission adopted a recommendation on how Member States could eliminate double taxation of inheritances. On the same occasion the Commission provided guidance to the Member States on how to ensure that cross-border inheritance tax rules do not involve discrimination. The objective is very simple: to take action to tackle cross-border inheritance tax obstacles across the European Union and resolve cases of double taxation. The aim is to ensure that the overall level of tax on a given inheritance is not higher than the level that would apply if only one Member State had tax jurisdiction over the inheritance. The recommendation calls on Member States to grant tax relief when applying inheritance taxes and to improve the cooperation of tax authorities to assist taxpayers subject to double taxation. The Commission will report on the state of play of Member States’ provisions for relief for double taxation of inheritances next year. If the report demonstrates that cross-border inheritance tax problems persist, the Commission will consider all the different options, including the need to take appropriate legislative action to eliminate those obstacles. Finally, in the meantime, the Commission would like to use today’s debate to call on the Member States to step up their cooperation and put the Commission recommendation in place."}

Instead of having politicians every seven years politically decide how we finance the European Union, this will be made in an automatic, in a transparent way.

We are supporting it as a European Parliament and on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party, I would like to announce that we are supporting the report as is put forward by the two co-rapporteurs. They have the wide backing of Members of the European Parliament and we are expecting the Council to progress swiftly with work in these areas. The introduction of own resources will likewise allow Member States to limit their direct contributions to the budget. We will collect the revenues through the own resources and it will also allow us to pay back NextGenerationEU in a stable, transparent way in the long term. This basket of own resources also allows for the responsibility, when it comes to revenues, to be in an equal, balanced manner between Member States and different categories of contributions.

Roaming is an example of how we are responding to the wishes of the citizens of Europe. Recently, a student from the University of Linz complained to me that she had paid EUR 3.60 a minute for a conversation that she had had in Brussels with her boyfriend in Munich, which would have cost her only EUR 0.07 per minute from home. The exorbitant bill that she received for a conversation lasting two hours was more expensive than her entire stay in Brussels. Ms Reding has reacted quickly. We were able to adopt the Roaming I Regulation in record time, within a period of only seven months. For the first time, there was a sunset clause. As a result of the rapid introduction of rules at a European level, we are remaining up-to-date in this area and can offer our citizens corresponding benefits. This represents a huge advantage for consumers. Many speakers today have emphasised that this is all about prices. I would like to dispute that. We are not regulating prices. Instead, we are making it clear at what point our citizens have the right to protection against abuse. We put our trust in the industry when it came to data roaming. The industry promised us that dramatic reductions would be forthcoming. This did not happen with Roaming II and that is why we now have this Roaming III Regulation. When you realise that you can still buy a one gigabyte data package in one Member State for EUR 4, that you may be forced to pay up to EUR 13 900 for this package elsewhere, and that in other countries outside Europe, the cost is currently between EUR 2 500 and EUR 3 500, it is clear that the reduction to EUR 700 is a huge step forward. Finally, I would like to express my gratitude for the fact that this figure will fall to EUR 200 by 2014. However, given that a figure of EUR 4 is normal at a national level, I am calling today for a Roaming IV Regulation."}

The damage that money laundering can cause should never be underestimated. Where criminal activity in our economic markets is concerned, transparency is a powerful weapon. Therefore, the opportunity presented to myself, my fellow rapporteurs and shadows to right the wrongs of past legislation has been both a challenge and a privilege. Throughout the process, we have looked at international standards, at FATF, and at the need to combat money laundering beyond the borders of the EU and in full cooperation with the rest of the world. The ability to follow money across borders and seize back assets is important, and so is the space in which criminals are able to operate. I believe that this package will help both to diminish that space for criminals and also to assist us in our ability to follow the money across those borders. For years, both consumers and businesses have run into difficulties with implementing previous legislation on this subject. Our aim has been to create, this time, a sensible, proportionate and effective way forward in the fight against money laundering. I have to say that the second Anti—Money Laundering Directive – with which I and others here were concerned – was interpreted ultimately and implemented in my own country, in the UK, in a way that made life almost intolerable for small investors and those who desired a normal, balanced relationship with their financial institutions. This kind of undue burden must not be recreated with an even tougher new regime. The need to create fuller transparency, balanced with considering the wider impact upon privacy and the need to provide data protection, has also been a key element of our work. The terms ‘proportionality’ and ‘necessity’ are brought up time and time again in our work here in Parliament, never more relevantly than in our work on this package. Previous directives have had the effect of providing an excuse, sometimes, for institutions, including banks and building societies, to move their decision-making further away from their consumers and to introduce totally proscriptive and impractical ways of assessing customers. Businesses and financial services need to know what they are looking for and how to address the problem. There needs to be an effective reporting and supervisory system, but equally countries need to comply with, and not just sign up to, international principles and methods, as well as to ensure good cooperation with third countries. If businesses and our trading partners around the world are going to continue to invest in Europe, and if the single market is to grow and prosper, it is essential we have the right legislative tools and European cooperation in place in order to prevent and prosecute financial crime. Above all else, I hope we have delivered something which is consistent and workable here. For me the ability to effectively implement the package was at the forefront of my mind when I was dealing with the section that I was responsible for. You can have the best laws in the world, but if they are not well implemented, you gain nothing. I now believe, thanks to this package, we will be gaining a lot. I would like finally to thank all those involved as far as my work is concerned: my co-shadow Mr Simons, the shadow rapporteurs and the other co-rapporteurs. I hope that the vote tomorrow is the start of a new era in the fight against money laundering, using common sense, but also bringing public acceptance at the same time."}

And former US Secretary of State Pompeo boasted that this was what US sanctions had resulted in, a humanitarian crisis, he said, that was increasing by the hour. He seemed to revel in the fact that it was increasing pain and suffering to the Venezuelan people, and the Biden administration is continuing on with these sanctions. The Venezuelan government had reached an agreement that has now broken down, showing how weak trust is. Against that backdrop, the decision of the US to reimpose sanctions is really dangerous.

A well-designed social market economy is essential for Europe, and in particular for a good functioning monetary union. I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Hetman, for putting this aspect forward in the report we have discussed today. We share your analysis of recent socioeconomic developments. It is in line with our findings in the annual Employment and Social Developments in Europe review. The economic conditions are favourable. With 239 million people in employment, employment is at its highest level ever. Unemployment in the euro area is now standing at 8.1%, the lowest since November 2008. We also share the opinion that there is still room for improvement. With the roadmap for deepening the EMU from December 2017 the Commission clearly set the objectives to address this. We stand for more jobs, growth, investment, social fairness and macroeconomic stability. We cannot have a robust economy without well-performing employment and social policies: both are two sides of the same coin, as we know. These policies are at the heart of the European Pillar of Social Rights and their development should lead to a stronger European Monetary Union (EMU). Hence, improving economic resilience requires us to invest in people, invest in the skills of workers throughout their working life. That is why we have launched and are implementing the New Skills Agenda. We live in a fast-moving economy that requires us to adapt. We have to be skilled and re—skilled on a continuous basis. Lifelong learning is not just a buzzword. It is a necessity. To ensure that workers get protection and the relevant information about their job: that is what our proposal on transparent and predictable working conditions for all workers calls upon. To give everyone the possibility to combine their professional and personal lives: Our proposal on work-life balance calls for better working arrangements and compensated leave for parents and carers. As you know, these last two are legislative proposals still in negotiations between Parliament and the Council. We count on your support to reach an agreement soon. Legislation, however, is not the only instrument to have for stronger employment and social policies in the European Union and a more resilient EMU. The implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights by Member States is crucial to reaching this objective and the instrument to have to monitor and gauge progress is the European Semester. When zooming in on the euro area, the Pillar is already fully integrated into the dedicated recommendation adopted in November last year. It asks Member States to focus on reforms that promote job creation, equal opportunities, accessibility to labour market, fair working conditions and support social protections. To conclude, let me stress that building a strong European economy and a resilient monetary union can only be sustainable through support and investment in our people. This requires well-functioning labour markets and social protection systems. In this light, we can only welcome and share the policy priorities indicated in your report."}
{"id": "75b25199-3c08-4a80-a109-a7e25a60e2cf", "text": "Mr President, we are having this debate today on women’s working conditions because women and men experience different conditions on the labour market. Women are trailing a long way behind men when it comes to wages, pensions, top jobs and executive positions. More than ever, therefore, we need the EU to take initiatives that improve the position of women on the labour market so that we can bring Europe into line with the treaty. We must ensure that women – whether they are from Portugal or Poland, Belgium or Bulgaria – are guaranteed equality on the labour market. A major and important step towards complete equality is a new and modern piece of EU legislation on maternity leave. There are many good reasons for us to have new legislation on maternity leave in Europe. First and foremost, there is a risk that, before long, the EU will face a demographic crisis – a crisis that could be at least as serious as the economic crisis in which we still find ourselves. Women in the EU are quite simply not having enough children. If we are to retain our competitiveness in the future and create growth, which is necessary in order to maintain our level of prosperity, more children need to be born in the EU. We therefore need a maternity leave law that motivates families to have children. A common high standard for maternity leave is essential in order to create an effective internal market. An internal market should not only be about cheap goods – it is just as important to ensure high social standards for workers. We must not have disparate competitive conditions, where it could be advantageous to lower the conditions for women, who will then become victims of social dumping. Fathers must also have the right to two weeks’ paternity leave on full pay. If we are to create equality between men and women, we need to understand that men also play an important role in connection with paternity leave. This will have a beneficial effect on equality, the children and, not least, the fathers themselves. We hear from the lobbyists for professional associations that this is a crazy thing to do and that we cannot afford better maternity leave legislation. I would venture to claim that quite the opposite is true. We cannot afford not to ensure that we have new, modern maternity leave legislation. It is a question of the health and safety of the EU’s women and children. Thus, this is not something that we should gamble with. We must increase the participation of women on the labour market throughout the EU. The objective of the EU 2020 strategy is to get 75% of all women on to the labour market. As we know that currently, only 60% of women work, this will be a major challenge. We must succeed, however, and there is no doubt that good facilities for childcare are the way forward. A second and equally important initiative, however, is full pay during maternity leave. Only by preventing discrimination against women can we get more women on to the labour market. Another important step towards more equality on the labour market is the report on precarious women workers, for which I was rapporteur. Unfortunately, the situation is such that women are significantly over-represented when it comes to these jobs. Women employed in private homes, in particular, have very precarious working conditions, characterised, among other things, by little or no job security, no social security, a high risk of discrimination and a poor working environment. We must not allow women to work under such poor conditions. The EU should therefore support the Member States to enable the precarious jobs to be replaced by proper jobs with decent working conditions. For a long time, we have neglected to focus on these vulnerable women, and it is my hope that the Commission will take this report seriously and help to take care of some of the EU’s most vulnerable citizens."}

The responses of our 27 Member States are, however, shameful. An estimated 81 100 women and girls were murdered intentionally in 2021. More than half of them were killed as a consequence of domestic violence. More than 60% of women have experienced some kind of violence on their phone or online. Every third woman over 15 in the EU is a survivor of physical or sexual violence. But these are not only figures: behind every and each number there is a person, a woman, a girl, a mother, a daughter, a nurse, a doctor, even a lawmaker. No place is safe: homes, schools, workplaces, squares, streets or social media platforms. Women and girls are continually being punchbags and shooting boards for men. Together with my co-chief-negotiator Frances Fitzgerald I am continuing the struggle to ensure that our 27 Member States understand that we must have a strong directive to combat this heinous violence. But the year is 2023, and still a majority of our Member States refuse to include the most important legislation as a part of the package – consent-based rape legislation.

I share the report’s assessment that we should ensure ongoing dialogue with China in all forums. Our fisheries relations should be synchronised with other EU policies and the broader bilateral context. Last month Commissioner Sinkevičius was in China for the high-level dialogue on oceans. The dialogue took place just days after the EU and China both signed in New York the UN Treaty on Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction. China also joined the WTO Fisheries Subsidies Agreement. Commissioner Sinkevičius was assured by China that the decision process to ratify the Port State Measures Agreement is at the last stage. We should build on this momentum to achieve tangible results in the priority areas identified by the report. On transparency, China has taken steps regarding vessels operating solely in the on the high seas. We should continue to push for transparency on Chinese vessels authorised to operate in coastal states, on fisheries agreements, catches, subsidies and business structures. Regarding flags of convenience, I can announce that the Commission will carry out a dedicated study. Autonomous tariff quotas for fishery products ensure supply to the EU processing industry. The Commission will assess the current regime for future policy choices, considering the sustainability of the fishery imports, with reference to EU standards and sustainability norms. We will continue advocating for a level playing field for EU fishing companies vis-à-vis Chinese companies seeking EU market access. On sustainability, China has so far honoured its commitment to cap its long distance fleet and halve the total number of fishing vessels, but it remains the largest fleet globally. The reduction in fleet size does not guarantee sustainability. Regarding the human and social dimension of sustainability, the Commission has proposed a European ban on products made with forced labour. The proposal covers imported goods, including fishery products, without targeting specific companies or industries. It is for the Council, acting upon a proposal from a Member State or from the High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, to establish, review and amend the sanctions list under the EU’s global human rights sanctions regime. We cooperate with China in the Bilateral Working Group on Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing since 2015. The Commission makes concrete suggestions for improved fleet management and control, and witnesses multiplication of sanctions on Chinese long distance vessels. We want China to go further to effectively prevent and sanction illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. We hold annual working groups with the US and Japan on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and exchange catch certification data on imports of fisheries products, including from China. In all regional fisheries management organisations, to which the EU and China are parties, we promote strong monitoring, control and surveillance, including both State measures and proper compliance assessments. The Commission deploys all instruments to strengthen the capacities of coastal states to address illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in their waters and regulate fishing activities aimed at sourcing raw materials for fishmeal. Through our Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreements, we strengthen partners’ human and technical capacities and legal frameworks. The agreements are a global benchmark for transparency and enable information sharing on access agreements with other partners. Internally, the Commission works closely with Member States to strengthen the implementation of the EU catch certification scheme. In the past year, China sanctioned ten processing companies and revoked three export authorisations thanks to Member States’ checks and verifications. China expressed interest in the voluntary use of IT CATCH. Honourable Members of the Parliament, cooperation with China on fisheries has increased over the years. Challenges as well. We continue our dialogue relentlessly to ensure China meets its global responsibilities. We look forward to an ongoing dialogue with you on the way forward."}

Trends: trade in liquefied natural gas and soya beans are developing in line with expectations expressed in the July joint statement and have contributed to EU energy security and provided our farmers with protein at competitive prices. Two weeks ago, the Commission adopted two recommendations for opening negotiations, one on industrial tariffs and one on conformity assessment. The one on industrial tariffs is quite self—explanatory and it does not include agriculture, as agreed in July. The proposed mandate on conformity assessment maybe deserves a little explanation. Both the EU and the US have in their respective practices of conformity assessment the purpose to ensure that manufacturers can only place a product on the market when it meets all the applicable requirements to ensure that unsafe or otherwise non—compliant products do not find their way to unsuspecting consumers. In some cases this requires mandatory third-party certification. Differences in approaches to conformity assessment can result in significant additional costs without improving the safety of the products. So our aim with this recommendation for negotiations on conformity assessment is to reduce the unnecessary costs while making sure that we fully maintain our respective levels of protection. The two recommendations thereby fulfilled the commitment that we took in July. They recognise that progress with the Trump administration is at this stage only possible with individual projects agreed on both sides. So I believe that the various strands of work we have initiated together through this process since July will add to a significant agenda with benefits from both sides. We can make every effort to project a positive trade agenda with the US on its own merits and also it is important not to fall back into a destructive cycle of trade restrictive measures and counter actions. At the same time, we must be very clear that any thought of going beyond the joint statement and negotiating a comprehensive and all encompassing trade agreement with the US is neither feasible nor advisable at this time. The US is also not ready to negotiate on its sensitivities, such as public procurement by American maritime services, or geographical indications. In addition, one of the important lessons that we have learnt during the TTIP negotiation is that the regulatory agenda with the US is best developed in full transparency, but outside the context of FTA negotiations. Furthermore, there are differences in some important trade-related rule areas where opposition will be very difficult to bridge. So our efforts are more likely to bear fruit if we seek to cooperate with the US in reforming certain multilateral trade rules that are ripe for an update. We are of course remaining vigilant and we will be ready to respond firmly in case the US would no longer respect commitments given in July and would adopt further restrictive measures vis—à—vis the EU, but this scenario would not be of our choosing. I’m looking forward to the debate."}

Yet the only solution that people in here can come up with is to continue the failed policies that you’ve been implementing for the last two years. So I voted against this resolution. I voted against it because only 93 people in here consider that it is necessary in all conflicts to undertake diplomatic efforts to end them, because only 71 people here regret that political and diplomatic efforts are not being used to end the war. I regret the fact that Parliament failed to take account of the writing-off and the cancellation of Ukraine’s debt to adhere to human rights and labour rights, and so on. The truth of the matter is that the only interests we’re serving are the ones of the military industrial complex – not Ukraine at all."}

Against the background of the accident in Buizingen it is, of course, important for us to show respect towards the victims and also towards the investigation. For this reason, we must not jump to conclusions about the accident and, more significantly, we must not begin assigning blame. I felt that the Commission acted correctly in strongly rejecting the accusation by the Belgian National Railways that the European Rail Traffic Management System has taken too long to develop. We know that safety remains a national priority and that this will continue to be the case. At a European level, we – and this includes both the Commission and Parliament – have always regretted the fact that the rail companies do not give higher priority to safety and to interoperability between the different systems in Europe. After accidents have occurred, new proposals are often made in a political context. I must say that in this case, everything was in place, both the legislation and the technology. The only thing which perhaps was lacking was the will to make the technology a high priority. Since the middle of the 1990s, the technology has been available to enable the safe transition between the European system and the advanced Belgian system, in other words, the so-called TBL 1+ system. There has been no lack of time or of technical facilities. The future is what is important to me and I would like to emphasise the following points. Firstly, we must not, under any circumstances, cut back on training in the rail industry. That has not been, nor will it be, one of the EU’s obligations. The railways have highly skilled staff and this must remain the case in future. Secondly, we need definite, binding conversion plans from the rail companies and the countries. Leaving everything to goodwill is no longer sufficient. We need a precise timetable and we will soon have the opportunity in Parliament to find out about specific objectives. My third proposal is that passengers should also have the right to know whether the stretch of track and the rolling stock that they travel on meet the highest safety standards. This is the minimum level of information which must be made available to passengers in future. We also need to investigate how we can put in place a mandatory requirement to do this."}

And we can do that with the support and at the behest of over one million of our citizens that signed the European Citizens’ Initiative, the most democratic and powerful instrument our community has developed. I am convinced that peace and stability in post-war Europe is not only due to the reconciliation of European nation states, but also to a reconciliation between the majority and indigenous minorities within our nation states. Territorial integrity of modern states is protected by political convention and international law. Now it is our duty to legislate to safeguard each and every minority, regardless of where they reside, and grant them rights – a key to their prosperity and our civilisation’s stability. Therefore, I implore you, all my colleagues, regardless of which political groups you represent, to support this historic initiative."}

It is through respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms that a democratic regime can ultimately be recognised. We must therefore welcome the fact that, on 19 May, the Council indicated that the European Union had to adopt a more consistent approach to democratic governance. The efforts made up to that point had been largely inadequate. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a striking example of this. Although the mission sent to observe the 2006 Palestinian elections recognised the legitimacy of their result, the European Union and its Member States chose to boycott the elected government, just as they boycotted the government of national unity formed thereafter to break that deadlock. Where is the European Union’s consistency and credibility when its own decisions contrast so sharply with its much-vaunted principles? And what can be said of the Member States that refuse to endorse the Goldstone report? Its conclusions are fair and balanced, and universal support for them would represent a step towards peace. It is this hope that the major powers are destroying, and they are destroying it through their lack of courage and their lack of loyalty to their own values. Organising election observation missions is therefore not enough, especially when one refuses afterwards to acknowledge the result. We must be true to ourselves and take a global approach to these issues. The Council should swiftly adopt a programme of action along these lines, with the creation of a genuine strategy for human rights, which would be imperative at all levels of the EU. We need to outline our priorities clearly and integrate them formally into all of our instruments: foreign policy, human rights policy and development policy. What kind of monitoring will we carry out in those third countries in which the European Union observes the elections in order to ensure respect for political pluralism and the involvement of civil society in the long term? What are our demands as regards the establishment of an independent judiciary and of institutions that are transparent and accountable to their citizens? The persistent vagueness concerning the place accorded to human rights in our policies is reprehensible and counterproductive. It is time to clear this up if we want the European Union and its most fundamental values to be taken more seriously at international level."}

I believe in importance to prepare for new security challenges affected by the climate change, which could increase threats and have geopolitical consequences. We can already witness that in areas such as the Arctic or the Sahel. I also want to point out the water issue.

The taxonomy is very clearly to harmonise claims by investor, what is a green and a sustainable investment. We’re not talking about banning any investment. We are talking about what is a green investment, nothing more, nothing less than that. Unfortunately, in the proposal, and we are having that discussion for a longer while already, you are green or you are not green. I know some are saying that there are different categories, but in the end – and that is now also very clear from any ongoing and follow up on any legislation, think for example of the green bonds – the moment you comply with the taxonomy and there is taxonomy alignment, then there is a green label and you are having a green bond. So there is no ‘amber’ category at all or whatsoever. Secondly, on the process – and here the Parliament has been very clear – the Parliament has been sidelined in this process. When we had the first delegated acts, there was a very clear public consultation for weeks, and then it took months before that delegated act was being published. On this second complementary delegated act, there was no public consultation. The Member States were being asked to reply too, the Parliament was only unofficially invited, but there was no formal consultation and the Parliament can only say something now. On the contents, on nuclear first of all, it’s very controversial. Will any investor really step in because of a green label? Absolutely not, because an investor will need security from the government. This green label will not work and will not help. This is a pure political game by France. The criteria are written by France, for France. Even the Netherlands has said that the criteria they cannot comply with. This clearly shows that this is a political game by France only. Then, on gas, first of all, we are making a separate category here for gas and having a higher emission threshold over other energy. Everyone who is claiming we need to be technology—neutral, why are we then having a separate category for gas and for the others you still have a threshold of over 100, whereas for gas it can be 270. This is not technology—neutral. And on top of that, we now have the war in Ukraine. How can we label gas green, and LNG terminals will not comply, but gas from Russia can? That is the opposite direction and we have to stop this idea. This is the moment to stop this delegated act."}

It is right and necessary for the judicial and police cooperation in Europe to be discussed and codecided by Parliament. Only in this way can Europol’s work enjoy sufficient legitimacy. The European Parliament’s joint and decisive rejection of the provisions proposed by the Council, pertaining to Europol’s work, is a clear signal that amendments to the legal basis now have to be applied. What is more, there is every reason to do so. For far too long, the implementation of European internal and security policy has been a task reserved exclusively for the executive, carried out behind closed doors. Not least in the context of the anti-terrorism measures taken following the attacks on 11 September 2001, numerous rafts of security legislation were approved, whose necessity, effectiveness and suitability was, in many cases, not thoroughly assessed, or even discussed. The political remoteness of the third pillar of the European Union has made it possible for the governments to impose highly controversial restrictions on the fundamental rights of the citizens. This has produced a very dangerous imbalance in one area in particular. While there is now closer cooperation between the security forces throughout the world, there is no international consensus on minimum standards in relation to fundamental rights and legal protection. This gulf between government powers and civil rights is becoming increasingly pronounced, especially with regard to the exchange of personal data between the EU and third countries,. European security agencies such as Europol, Eurojust and Frontex, as well as information systems such as Schengen, Eurodac or the customs and visa database, are being used to store an increasing volume of personal data, and the linking and analysis of this data, for various purposes, is progressing rapidly. Even within Europe, it is becoming less clear who is allowed to collect, possess, analyse or pass on what data, and the conditions under which they may do so. Thus, the issue of legal protection is frequently sidelined, in the light of the principles which govern the current system. However, what would happen if all this data was passed on only to third countries? We are not merely talking about countries such as Norway or Switzerland, but also the United States, Russia, and even Morocco or China. I wonder who would guarantee that this data was protected from abuse and arbitrary actions on the part of states to the same extent as has hitherto been the case. This Parliament actually has the right and the duty to use the new legal basis provided by the treaty to initiate a process whereby the fundamental rights of European citizens will have to be respected, without any limitations, including in the context of international cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism. Common minimum standards must be put in place, specifically with regard to the protection of personal data, before we, as the European Union, sign any further agreements on the exchange of data with third countries. This applies to the information obtained by Europol, as well as SWIFT banking data and flight passenger data, which are exchanged with the US authorities. Clear data protection standards, a comprehensive proportionality assessment and effective legal protection for citizens are key prerequisites for any further measures. I am pleased that we have managed to reach this level of consensus across the political spectrum regarding the legislation on Europol, and I view this as a good sign for the forthcoming discussion on the comprehensive protection of fundamental rights in Europe. That is precisely what EU citizens now expect from us."}

In the Netherlands, much attention has been focused on the fate of Cor Disselkoen. In 1997, this Dutch entrepreneur was charged with breaching the Polish taxation rules. He spent two months in prison for this, in appalling conditions. Having paid a very large amount of money as bail, he was released and for twelve years he heard nothing more about this case. However, last year, Poland suddenly demanded this entrepreneur’s extradition. On this occasion, Poland made use of the European Arrest Warrant. Ten days ago, he was transferred to Poland. Mr Disselkoen’s lawyer says he was held there in a prison which was just as filthy and overcrowded as the one in which he was held in 1997. Contrary to all the rules, the consultation between Disselkoen and his lawyer was recorded with a video camera. In addition, four new charges were suddenly added to his sheet. The judge even insinuated that these could lead to a new arrest warrant. Disselkoen has once again paid a large amount of money as bail and is back in the Netherlands, but his case shows that the European Arrest Warrant may lead to degrading situations. In its report, the Commission has demonstrated that it is aware of the problems and that it is concerned about them. That is why my group is pinning its hopes on the Commissioner. Commissioner, can you personally offer any explanation of how the proportionality requirements should be interpreted and arrange for this to be taken over by the Council? Can you make sure that people will actually be entitled to challenge an arrest warrant in both the Member State which has issued the warrant and the Member State which is carrying it out? Do you agree that it ought to be possible to consistently refuse to carry out arrest warrants on behalf of countries where conditions in prisons and houses of detention remain inhumane, that the EAW will be subjected to a human rights assessment and that Cor Disselkoen need not fear even more misery?"}

I will just make one or two remarks, concerning firstly the language issue, and addressed in particular to Mrs Lefrançois. I must say that the Commission considered that the proposal that asylum seekers must be informed in a language that they are likely to understand is balanced. The aim of this measure is to enable adequate information to be given to asylum seekers whilst making it possible to combat potential cases of abuse on the part of some asylum seekers. I should like now to thank Parliament. However, you will allow me to express my surprise at Mr Pirker’s speech, in particular. Mr Pirker, I cannot allow you to distort the Commission’s proposal. When I hear you say that the Dublin revision could lead to a ‘shopping’ forum, I cannot allow it, it is not possible and it is not true. The Commission’s proposal does not change the principles on which the Dublin system is based. Asylum seekers will not be able to choose the State of asylum, although it is true that the State responsible will be determined on the basis of objective criteria, but with account taken of more humane considerations, and of family reunification in particular. I cannot believe that, as a member of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, you are not mindful of this problem of family reunification. I cannot allow you to distort this proposal. For the Commission as well, it is a matter of establishing clear-cut guarantees in order to avoid abuse of the system. We have introduced, among other things, a mechanism to identify vulnerable persons. Obviously, the Member States must ensure the fair, balanced implementation of the principles that we have suggested. I would also say to Mr Blokland that it is important not to confuse Frontex’s missions with those of the support office. They are different missions requiring different skills if we really want asylum applications to be dealt with in Europe with the necessary rigour and humanity. I cannot believe that the European Parliament is unable to find broad agreement on the basis of the work completed by the rapporteurs. Of course, you belong to different political families with different political and philosophical sensibilities, but let us not forget that this Europe, which has witnessed persecution and sometimes the major risks that put the lives of the persecuted in danger, is not a model in this area. This is not about idealistic preaching; it is about being faithful to our values. I insist on this. I, personally, need very broad support from the European Parliament."}

It is not by chance that the Committee on Culture’s decisions are constantly ending up in the conciliation procedure, for one or other Member State in the Council always holds culture hostage to other interests. In this way, the unanimity principle has shown itself to be a blockading instrument of the first order. The battle for a workable compromise lasted almost two years, and now, at long last, the European Parliament can give the go-ahead. The Council could not be moved, not even when the precursor programmes Kaleidoscope, Ariane and Raphael finished. A pilot programme was called for to bridge the gap. This showed up the weaknesses of the European Union’s cultural policy activities once again. The political fight over funding and programme structuring is out of all proportion to the volume of support. Out of 410 applications in 1999 only 55 projects with a low overall volume of EUR 6.07 million could be considered. The Council was not prepared in the case of this particular programme to accommodate Parliament to the tune of even a single euro! And so the moderate sum of 167 million will stand until 2004. That is the same as a single, medium-sized, German opera house’s expenditure over the same period, when here in Europe this sum has been earmarked for 29 countries over a period of five years! There is a blatant discrepancy here! And so we are going to have to be content, albeit very grudgingly, with the fact that we have at least managed to achieve something in terms of content. Previous speakers have already kindly pointed this out. We can only hope that it will, after all, be possible to persuade the Council to have a change of heart one day. Perhaps the Council will come to understand that cultural activities do the European Union good, not harm! Cultural cooperation – and this was also mentioned earlier – truly creates identity, far more so than any transport directive, however important it might be. Providing support for culture meets with wide-spread acceptance, and this certainly cannot be said of all policy decisions. What, may I ask, is the Council afraid of?"}

Wolves are returning to regions of the Union from which they have long been absent. Increasingly, this is leading to conflict and challenges for some stakeholders and especially for livestock farmers, because of increasing depredation and killing of livestock. For that reason, on 20 December last year, in line with the commitment we made and in response to the resolution passed by this House, the Commission published an in-depth analysis on the situation of the wolves in the EU. It contains, inter alia, the most up-to-date data available for wolf populations and damage to livestock. Our analysis confirmed that after a long period of persecution, leading to near extinction, European wolf populations have made a significant recovery. This has been especially noteworthy in the last two decades and wolves now occupy large areas of their former natural range. On the basis of this in-depth analysis, the Commission tabled a proposal for a Council decision on the same day, asking the Union to submit them an amendment to the Bern Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats. The proposed amendment would move the wolf from Appendix 2 – that means strictly protected species – to Appendix 3. The proposal for a Council decision is now under consideration by Member States under the leadership of the Belgian Presidency. The Commission is looking forward to a swift decision on this proposal. At the same time, the Commission continues to urge local and national authorities to take appropriate action wherever necessary, as permitted by the derogation possibilities in the current legislation. Several Member States make regular use of such derogations to authorise lethal control of wolf specimens and specimens of other protected species as well. As stressed by the Commission on several occasions, it is key to keep investing in damage prevention measures. Indeed, irrespective of any decision on the legal status of the wolf, it will always be essential to adopt prevention measures in order to reduce livestock depredation. More and more Member States are now using the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development to programme support for damage prevention actions and investments. For the period 2023-27, 15 Member States have included relevant measures in their CAP strategic plans, bringing tangible solutions to farmers and local communities. And as permitted under EU State aid rules, many Member States now provide full compensation to farmers whenever damage is caused by the wolf or other protected species. To achieve our common objectives, I would like to recall the recommendations that Commissioner Sinkevičius and Commissioner Wojciechowski have sent to all Member States in November 2021, inviting them to make the best possible use of all the available EU and national funding opportunities. The support from the Commission will continue. We are stepping up financial support as well as our help to national authorities and stakeholders to find suitable solutions to facilitate this coexistence, in line with EU legislation and policy goals."}

It was highlighted once again that an immediate solution needs to be found to the impasse which SIS II is currently at. However, I get the impression that instead of answers, there are even more questions raised after the discussions about SIS II. The Council supports the implementation of an analysis and repairs plan to help identify the problems with SIS II’s technical architecture, with the aim of making it stable and reliable. On the other hand, the Council does not exclude the possibility of deciding to adopt an alternative technical solution which can achieve the objectives proposed by SIS II. Whichever of the options is applied, it must not have repercussions on the schedule for the inclusion of the countries which are still excluded from the Schengen area. I would like to know what measures the Commission will adopt to avoid any possible delay and how the additional costs incurred by these changes will be covered. The example of Romania speaks for itself. Romania’s external border is 2 000 km long. Its integration into the Schengen area scheduled for March 2011 is a major priority. All this indecision may have consequences in terms of meeting this deadline. I would like to mention one other thing. At a time when the Commission is preparing to draft a new legislative proposal on the next stages in border management, I would ask the Commission to evaluate first of all the effectiveness of the current systems used to manage borders in order to achieve the best synergy between these systems, and then assess the opportunity for investments in border logistics. In order to achieve the EU’s strategic objectives, the Commission should not start developing new tools from scratch until the existing ones, such as SIS II or VIS, are fully operational and reliable."}

He said he would kill me and my family if we didn’t leave the country – my home country. The threats never stopped, but my fear became anger and my anger became political action. I am European. I am elected by the people. A Member of this House. And I stand before you as the Greens/EFA candidate for President of this Parliament. To those of you who keep telling me that I don’t belong, you are wrong. The pro-democratic majority of this House will never allow you to define who belongs to this Parliament or to our European family. Standing here today my thoughts go to our dear colleague, the late President Sassoli. He will be remembered for his seemingly effortless commitment to the European project and the work of this House. Let us honour his legacy by standing up together for fundamental rights, European solidarity and a European Union for all. There are three little words written at the bottom of every resolution, every report and every legislative position in this House. Three small words that connect us all: united in diversity. I believe in a European Parliament of diversity, but believing in diversity as a strength also means we must defend this European project. The fundamental rights of EU citizens and the rules of democracy are not negotiable. As your President, I will listen to and learn from those who stand up for their rights and our common future. From young people demanding climate justice to minorities demanding a seat at the table and brave Europeans risking their own safety to help migrants at our common borders. When governments tell our citizens that they do not have the right to decide over their own bodies, we must stand with them. As your President, I would honour the legacy of the former President Simon Veil with an initiative to reward individuals and organisations fighting for sexual and reproductive health and rights wherever they are challenged in Europe. Dear colleagues, we must earn and protect the trust of our citizens by delivering on the biggest challenges that people around Europe face today. So let this Parliament be a force for social justice, green transition and fair recovery for all. This Parliament has declared a climate emergency. Let us act on it by ensuring that the Commission delivers on the Green Deal. Let’s raise the bar for climate action and the protection of biodiversity, and let’s earn the title as guardian of the treaties, when the Commission fails to fulfil this role. This House must lead by example. As your President, I will work tirelessly for a European Parliament where diversity is an asset, not a disadvantage. Zero tolerance on sexism is possible. Let us make anti-harassment training mandatory. Let’s create an equal workplace with flexible methods. Let’s ensure transparency and internal democracy in this House, ending the time of back-room dealings. Let us practice what we preach by making sure our own institution is a front-runner in the green transition.

As the effects of climate change become more real and deadly, consumers are demanding to make empowered choices. Green products, sustainable practices and ethical sourcing are what a new generation of consumers want, and yet we actually make it more difficult for consumers to make these types of informed choices. Greenwashing and its consequences are a scourge. For too long, manufacturers have been able to claim that their product is sustainable or ethically sourced without requiring proof. This new legislation is a clear sign of action that the EU is prepared to give consumers proper information. Now consumers can rely on clear labelling. Generic environmental labels such as ‘biodegradable’, ‘eco-friendly’ and ‘climate neutral’ will be prohibited. Consumers will now have to be informed which products are more durable and reparable, and real consequences for traders and companies which do not abide by these laws. To achieve a truly sustainable economy, we must empower consumers."}

I totally agree. However, when I take a look at the programme, the theme often seems to be ‘carry on as before’. That may be the right thing to do in some areas but in other areas – above all in the area that we are discussing today – it cannot be right. We have to send out the signal that we have learnt from the crisis and that we are going to act differently to the way we have acted in the past. If you add the sentence, ‘Europe benefits from open societies and open markets but rules have to apply to both of them’, then it would be right, but perhaps not clear enough. We need rules so that Europe can benefit from open societies and open markets. This must be made clear and it has not always been the principle followed by the Commission. In your composition – if I may put it that way – you mention a ‘sudden crisis of confidence’. For a long time now, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen has been pointing out what might happen. Mr Schultz has also been talking about it for a long while now. The crisis in confidence was therefore not that sudden. Yet some people in the Commission were of the opinion that we do not have to regulate anything, that it would turn out alright, that the market would regulate everything. However, that was not what happened and change must be made. My second point is this. There is a subject which is still not part of this programme but which is very important for the citizens of Europe, namely the general public and public sector services. I mention this specifically because a crisis has now developed in some countries in connection with the postal service. This is not the fault of Europe or the Commission alone. However, it can be attributed to a particular attitude, namely that the market should rule in all sectors and it should be open in every respect, thus giving some postal services the incentive to acquire higher profits elsewhere instead of providing services to consumers, to the general public. This is taking us in the wrong direction. At the very least, I would have liked to have seen an unambiguous statement at the end of your programme indicating that you will speak up for these public sector services and say how they should be dealt with, both regionally and locally, and that the market does not regulate everything after all. Finally, I would like to endorse one of your points: we have a new US Government. I would like to ask you, Mr President, the Commissioner and everyone else to use the time and the next few weeks to work with this government to ensure that we create a genuine partnership for a European, and also global, social market economy. Let us take advantage of the opportunity afforded by a new US President."}

I will just run through a couple of elements that were raised in the debate. The people of North and South Sudan are undoubtedly the masters of their countries. We are supporting the process, but the referendum definitely represents a watershed: it is a completely new qualitative situation. It is not the same situation as before. Yes there is violence, there are difficulties, but the situation is different. Now we see a light at the end of the tunnel. So that is why I would say that it is a great victory for us because we supported the process politically, both through our own actions and in financial terms. So that is a completely new situation. We never compromised on human rights or International Criminal Court issues. Our position is very clear with regard to both the ICC and human rights. Whenever there is a violation of human rights, the High Representative makes very strong and clear statements and puts pressure on the authorities. It has been said that there is no immediate response, but changes are being made. It is not an easy process and we will continue to deal with it. On Abyei, the situation is difficult, but again the European Union position will be a very clear and strong condemnation of the occupation calling for the situation to be resolved immediately. It is basically up to the United Nations Security Council to decide on the situation. It will decide if there is to be another mission and if there is a United Nations Security Council resolution, we will be its greatest supporters. But what we need to bear in mind is our strong political stance and declaration and our support for civilian operations. I believe, as I said to South Sudan, that we should not expect all the issues to be resolved by 9 July. Independence will be declared, there will be ongoing discussions, and the important element is that the African Union Panel, chaired by Thabo Mbeki, has support from both sides, North and South. We are very firmly behind the Mbeki panel. So we have every reason to believe that all the difficult questions will be answered. With regard to the debt issue, work is under way as part of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative. This takes time and the Abyei issue certainly did not help. But that issue has not been forgotten. China, in as much as we can involve it, is a fully-fledged member of the Security Council and it would be a great help in finding solutions in the country. At this stage, I cannot claim that there has been a lot of activity with the Chinese. They are in oil, they are in the North of Sudan, but it is definitely a great help when the broader international community tries to find a solution to the issues. Last but not least, I am very grateful for your interest in Sudan. On the one hand, it is rather far from us but, on the other, it is very close. If things go wrong, if people are dying in Africa, the European Union cannot stay on the outside saying ‘well, it is too far’. Your broad interest in the issues definitely encourages both the High Representative and myself to put together efforts to help people build peaceful lives."}

I wish him much success in leading the not entirely straightforward group whose chairman he has now become. May your decisions, my dear Joseph, always be the right ones. I welcome our new Members from Bulgaria and Romania. We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament fought like no other in this House for the 1 January 2007 deadline to be retained, for, where the restoration of our continent’s unity in freedom, peace and – soon – undivided prosperity was concerned, we believed that the sooner it happened, the better. Today is a good day, for, from now on, our Bulgarian and Romanian friends are officially of our number, and that is also a success for our group. There are two reasons, as I see it, why it matters that I should say a word of thanks to you, Mr Borrell. I shall start with a word of apology. I have to apologise to you for all the unspeakable meetings of the Conference of Presidents, which you, in the chair, had to sit through and suffer through, enduring me and my temperament, which is, of course, notoriously equable, and which you attempted to keep within bounds as you watched over the proceedings. You did not always get your way, and nor, for that matter, did I, so, speaking personally, I ask your indulgence for all the things I put you through. I also, however, want to tell you, on behalf of the Socialist Group, that you made an extraordinarily dignified president for this Chamber. Within Europe and outside it, you brought great dignity to representing Europe and earned much respect for so doing. I was told by a member of the European Council that there is not one Head of State or Government who does not, at the councils of Heads of State or Government, listen attentively when Josep Borrell rises to speak, and there are two reasons for this, namely your personal dignity and the intelligent content of your speeches, to both of which, in equal measure, is attributable the fact that you were an outstanding representative of this freely-elected European institution. We in the Socialist Group voted for you; many Members of this House put their trust in you, new and unknown as you were, and I think I can speak for everyone when I say, today, that you justified that trust in every way. We, in the Socialist Group, rejoice that you are now returning to our ranks, to become, once more, an ordinary MEP. Everyone who knows you, knows that that is what you will be – an ordinary and unpretentious Member of this House – for you are capable of exercising high office and then returning to the anonymity of the ranks. It is that sort of personal modesty that is perhaps the distinguishing and outstanding characteristic of the personality that is Josep Borrell. Many warm thanks, then, from me, on behalf of my group, for all that you have done for this House."}
{"id": "32b78c65-4b76-48d1-8cdf-dbe82456c82e", "text": "Mr President, Commissioner, it’s a pity, actually, that the Council is absent. It would have been a very educational debate for them, I suppose. First of all, I would like to start by welcoming the annual report – the edition that we are discussing today. I think the next one is already in the making. And having been one of the driving forces behind it – the author actually of the legislative initiative proposal at the time for the annual report – I am very pleased to see that it is year on year developing into a very useful instrument, not least in connection with the Conditionality Regulation. However, if everything were fine, then we would have a very short debate. So I would like to express a couple of recommendations and concerns, nevertheless. First, on horizontal remarks, on the method – and we’ve had this exchange many times before so you are aware of the position of the European Parliament – we consider that further changes are needed. We need this report to become even more independent from the Member States. If we read the report of the European Commission, it is still fairly mild in describing situations which in reality are actually extremely worrying. I mean, if you read the report of the Commission, you think, okay, there are some concerns in the European Union, but it’s all under control. Whereas if you look at the overall picture, I’m a lot more worried than that. And I think if you use the sources outside your national interlocutors, the government interlocutors, then the picture is somewhat more grim. We have also repeatedly called for this report to be part of an interinstitutional agreement. And I find it very disappointing that the proposal of the European Parliament and the Commission to have cooperation with the Council on this topic – even in the shape of a pilot project – is being rejected by the Member States. I mean, that tells you something about the spirit in which they see this annual rule of law cycle. And finally, we also feel that the report would gain in strength and credibility if it’s drawn up by a panel of independent experts. Just this week, the European Court of Auditors has issued a report on the rule of law toolkit. It also includes some remarks on this report. And I think some of the remarks underline what I’ve just said. Secondly, in implementing or upholding the rule of law, neutrality vis-à-vis the Member States is key. And that was actually the reason behind this whole report – that all Member States will be measured by the same yardstick. And here I see a risk. I think that, contrary to what some people in Hungary might claim, any decision of the European Commission to intervene is not politically motivated. However, I sometimes detect some political motivation behind the decision not to intervene because there are some countries that would definitely justify an intervention. Finally, I think there are a couple of horizontal issues that we’ve addressed: independence of the judiciary, safety and freedom of journalists, the fight against corruption, the creation of equality bodies and such issues. But I would like to conclude with one issue that is particularly topical today. Today we are remembering the train crash at Tempe in Greece one year ago, which is very closely connected to corruption: a rail safety system that was not put in place because of reasons of fraud and corruption, which had been detected by the European Public Prosecutor, but not by the national authorities and not by the Commission. So you can see how corruption and fraud can literally cost lives. And therefore I think we should step up the fight against corruption even more."}

But let me share the frustration that we are not able to move in the problem of frozen assets even after many, many debates, so progress is badly needed. On the economy, we also should not forget that winter represents a stern challenge for us, and I hope that the Council will reflect on that. It would be good if the Council emphasised that some dossiers have to be finished, like the fiscal rules, and this is of very high importance for us. Also we need a discussion on the Green Deal, on how to make sure that the Green Deal works.

The European Union greatly admires the courage and the tireless work of Dr Denis Mukwege. His strong commitment to peace, justice and human rights in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has unfortunately exposed him to death threats. Despite that, he continues to devote his life to defending and restoring the dignity of countless women, the victims of brutal acts of violence, and we must continue to support his work. We have publicly condemned the most recent threats made against him and we are pleased to note that the UN has now decided to redeploy a unit for the safety of Dr Mukwege and the staff and patients of the Panzi Hospital. We remain extremely worried about almost daily attacks on the population in the east of the DRC. This cannot become a forgotten crisis 10 years after the UN Mapping Exercise Report. We are calling upon the DRC, supported by its international partners, in particular in the region and the United Nations Organisation Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO), to put an end to the violence and the impunity. The Congolese authorities should adopt and implement reforms to establish effective security institutions and an independent justice sector. Those responsible should be brought before justice so that the rights and dignity of the victims can finally be recognised. The EU is taking concrete action in this direction through support programmes for justice, the strengthening of the mechanism for prosecuting and supporting victims, including survivors of sexual and gender-based violence, and is continuing its direct support to Dr Mukwege’s Panzi Hospital, which so far amounts to EUR 19 million. We will never, never abandon the women and girls who had to go through the unspeakable pain of sexual violence, and stand ready to contribute to the support they need to rebuild their lives."}

There is no doubt that the issue of transposing EU law into national systems is a very serious problem within the Union. The same regulations are being introduced by various countries at different times which, in certain respects, is, of course, understandable. However, this should not lead to delays that cause a lack of legal surety and, as a consequence, make it impossible for citizens to exercise their rights. As our rapporteur correctly points out, delays in transposition as well as the incorrect application of EU law bring with them real costs and lead to a lack of trust in EU institutions among citizens. For this reason as well, I welcome all of the Commission’s initiatives such as meetings of experts and bilateral dialogue between the Commission and Member States, the aim of which is to resolve these problems as quickly as possible. I am observing with great interest the EU pilot programme, which is supposed to be a tool enabling a rapid response to all cases of incorrect application or adaptation of EU law to national legislation. We also emphasise once again the role that national courts play in the practical application and interpretation of EU law. This role will not be correctly performed, however, if appropriate training is not given, meetings are not held and an EU legal culture is not created. With regard to our Parliament – and I address my fellow Members – the law that we create, because we are legislators, must be clear and comprehensible, for only when it is understandable can it be transposed easily into national systems and will there be fewer problems associated with it."}

Parallel to military support, the EU together with other international partners has to find solutions to the worsening humanitarian situation.

In these conditions where many people have fled to neighbouring countries and the Tuareg rebels are operating, a cross-border humanitarian crisis could be sparked, possibly even war.

They set clear benchmarks on the basis of which aspiring European Member States’ accession paths could be assessed. The Copenhagen criteria are the following: First, stability and institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for, and protection of, minorities. Second, a functioning market economy and the ability to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the European Union. And third, the ability to take on the obligations of membership, including the capacity to effectively implement the rules, standards and policies that make up the body of European law, the acquis, and adherence to the aims of political, economic and monetary union. The criteria must be met for accession. They constitute a central element of our enlargement policy and remain a key pillar of our policy. Our yearly enlargement reports analyse the stability of institutions, the rule of law, known as the fundamentals of all aspiring European Union Member States. The functioning market economy and ability to cope with competitiveness are core to the economic chapters. We examine the alignment with the European acquis in our annual enlargement package, and in more detail during the screening process and when opening chapters during accession negotiations. Two weeks ago, as all of you know, we adopted a big enlargement package. Then country reports for the first time and the growth plan for the Western Balkans. The Commission recommended that the Council open accession negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova. The Commission recommended the opening of accession negotiations with Bosnia Herzegovina. Once the necessary degree of compliance with the membership criteria is achieved, latest by March of next year. Further, we recommended to grant candidate status to Georgia on the understanding that certain steps are taken. A functioning market economy and the ability to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the European Union are equally important as democratic institutions. This is why we are boosting investment and economic growth even before accession. The aim of the growth plan is to boost the economy of the Western Balkans in the next years, in order to close the socio-economic gap between the Union and our partners by the end of this decade. The offer provided by the Growth Plan is therefore a unique opportunity for the Western Balkans to speed up their economic growth and convergence with the European Union, as well as through targeted reforms accelerating the path towards European Union membership. Therefore, the Growth Plan is creating the possibility of early integration of the region into the European Union even before they join our Union. This House has a key role in making it happen. The financial pillar of the growth plan, the EUR 6 billion growth facility, needs to be adopted during the mandate of this Parliament, as we have no time to waste. Honourable Members, the Copenhagen Criteria have stood the test of time. They capture the essence of what a candidate country needs to do in order to prepare its political, economic and legal system for European membership. But most importantly, they are an expression of the foundation and values on which the European Union is built. The existence of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for, and protection of, minorities, the existence of functioning market economies, and the ability to take on the obligations of membership. We must continue building our joint future based on these criteria."}

It enables Member States to realise technology benefits that are too substantial for any individual Member State, and as well as that obvious economy of scale, the added value created by the space programme is considerable: the direct benefits, for example, of a competitive space sector worth around EUR 60 billion a year, providing 230000 high-skill, high quality jobs. Value—added benefits already realised in fishing policy, environmental programmes, precision farming, transport and traffic modelling are also contributors of added value. In this way, we get a greater return from EU budgets, and we also get data for better informed budget decision—making. A couple of cautionary words: the Commission is creating a European Union agency for the space programme from another agency. This carries some risks, we believe, of duplication with the activities of the European Space Agency. A tight definition of that agency’s brief and diligent scrutiny is the way to mitigate that risk. The progress of this departure, along with the adequacy of funding for Galileo, Copernicus and the new streams, should be reviewed at the mid-term of the MFF. And finally, it is worth observing as a cautionary note that some of the discussion has focused on the notion of a uniquely European Union space industry. The trouble is that there’s no such thing as a uniquely European satellite – space is global, and to approach it any other way may well prove an expensive mistake."}

However, instead of Europe putting the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy into practice, it is China that is doing so. In 2010, China’s public and private expenditure on research and development caught up with that of the European Union. In the very near future, China will have more engineers and researchers than the United States and the EU put together. Against this very worrying backdrop, Europe’s aerospace industry is the only sector that is still holding out, because France, Germany and Spain acted responsibly in this area, even though it was not easy for them, by investing in the long term and by not sticking to dogma on free, fair competition. It is true that Europe’s failure to do enough in the area of research is one of the causes of deindustrialisation in some parts of the EU. Whilst this report shows an element of lucidity, it falls far short of what it ought to be, especially in terms of its diagnosis of the causes of this alarming situation and the solutions it suggests. The crux of the problem is the lack of public investment in research, and the fact that it is subordinated to the financial markets’ aims and funding. It is also the fact that young researchers and engineers are in an insecure position and poorly paid, whilst parasitic financial professions, such as traders, earn scandalously high salaries, which amount to a reward for bad behaviour. Lastly, it is Europe’s failure to invest in developing a mass scientific and technical culture from the earliest age. It is becoming a matter of urgency for us to work towards incorporating know-how and knowledge as mainstream issues in society."}

I too am of the opinion that we should continue the One China policy to achieve the cohesion of China as a unified state, and that we do not want to jeopardise any of this. Of course, we do not permit violence – be it violence by demonstrators under particular circumstances or violence by the state against demonstrators, as was actually the case. I wanted to mention this first. However, we also need to understand that, in China, the violence of the central government which, in this multi-ethnic state with many cultural differences, does not show a sufficient degree of understanding, will always be a recurring problem. This is why greater cultural autonomy, greater opportunities for mobility and opportunities relating to the preservation of identity and language are all prerequisites for all the citizens of a multi-ethnic state to be able to live together under one roof. China’s history has consisted of a series of break-aways and reunifications with massive campaigns of violence. This can be seen again and again throughout China’s history. China needs to realise that this cannot go on and that it needs to introduce this autonomy. The Uighurs are a moderate Sunni minority. They pose no direct terrorist threat. There is therefore the same danger as we see in Tibet and that is that if China does not enter into agreements with the moderates, there are always young radicals who cannot and do not want to wait any longer. Therefore, delaying a solution with regard to identity delays a solution in the long term. The Chinese Government is extremely ill advised to talk only of terrorists, to claim that these people want to destroy the unity of the state and to say that outside forces like Al-Qaeda and others are behind this. I do not believe that this is a solution for this country and therefore we should make it clear that we do not accept such a policy.

Furthermore, biometric passports also have fundamental rights implications. It has just been ruled under French constitutional law that parts of the French biometric passport law are unconstitutional because law enforcement agencies and state authorities have access to fingerprints. Fingerprints are seen as very sensitive data because you can leave them without intending to do so. That of course calls into question whether this will be applicable in the Member States. We have also seen elsewhere in the EU that law enforcement agencies and authorities are trying to get access to fingerprints Even when all these questions have been solved, there will still be the issue of whether it is really necessary and useful to collect all the biometric data of people who travel, and for what purpose we are collecting those data. We will have to see whether the costs of such biometric gathering will actually be compatible with any use that we get out of them, and whether the costs are appropriate and comparable with their usefulness. I do not think under any circumstances that we should collect more and more biometric data and expand the use of biometric data before those concerns are clarified and before the Commission can prove that they are actually verifiable and that there are no huge problems and errors in collecting the data, as we heard with regard to children, older people, etc."}

I very much welcome this report as a valuable contribution to the Commission’s preparatory work on the future external financing instruments. I fully share your conviction that we have to remain ambitious in the financing of EU external action after 2020. Heading four has been stretched to the limits during this Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). We have been facing unprecedented levels of crisis world-wide, from conflicts to natural and climate-related disasters, health epidemics, insecurity and massive displacement and migration. As the report rightly points out, we need to work harder to deliver on the international commitment of the European Union and its Member States to devote 0.7% of gross national income to official development assistance (ODA) by 2030. The ODA figures published a few days ago show that our collective, aggregate ODA has gone down. Even if we are still the world’s largest donor, we cannot accept such a downward trend. I agree that, overall, the current set of instruments has proven useful and strategically relevant, and enabled the European Union to adapt to evolving situations and needs in strategic sectors and regions. However, we need to have the courage to re-examine the next generation of external instruments. Our guiding policy framework with the 2030 Agenda, the Global Strategy, the European Neighbourhood Policy and the European consensus on development as well as the global challenges to which they are responding are highly complex and intertwined. The current multitude of programmes does not facilitate the necessary multi-dimensional approach to poverty eradication and sustainable development. I am therefore happy that the report calls for greater coherence and simplification. Indeed, we need to get rid of artificial boundaries within our current instruments to ensure the right synergies between different policies for different countries and regions. We must avoid working in silos, while preserving the focus on poverty eradication and on promoting European values. Keeping a comprehensive approach towards our partners is the best way to serve our mutual interests. By streamlining existing instruments, development cooperation can take a truly integrated and innovative approach, both from a geographical and thematic point of view. The policy-driven nature of financing instruments will also be reinforced. A streamlined architecture can facilitate our interinstitutional dialogue as well, by truly looking at the bigger picture, rather than specific envelopes. Having differentiated policies such as neighbourhood or development policy does not require having separate instruments. In this logical coherence, it should also make sense to integrate the European Development Fund into the EU budget. But I concur with the report that this should be done only if certain preconditions are met: the volume of funds, in particular for Africa, should not decrease and important elements of flexibility, such as significant reserves and multiannuality should be preserved. On humanitarian aid, I also agree with the report’s key findings. Humanitarian assistance should remain self-standing, taking account of the specific nature and principles of humanitarian assistance. We have been able to provide humanitarian aid rapidly and flexibly in most acute crises. This was possible, not least because of the principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence. As the recent comprehensive evaluation shows, our instrument is fit for purpose. It is also important that EU humanitarian aid continues to have adequate access to an emergency reserve to deal with unforeseen needs. We are committed to making sure that, whenever possible, humanitarian aid works hand in hand with longer-term instruments as part of the nexus approach in building resilience."}

Even if part of the profits of oil companies were spent on this, I am not convinced it would be enough. For this we have to, at the very least, advance on two other fronts, those being commitments by Member States, and centralised research and development. Let us look at the first: commitments and approaches by Member States. According to the Commission report before the European Parliament ‘several countries have still not taken practical steps in the interests of reaching stated objectives’, and at Community level the target of 22.1% (of energy) by 2010 (coming from renewable sources) is in danger, and a figure of only 18 to 19% looks realistic. Huge differences appear between the performances of individual Member States, with, for example, my own country of Hungary in last place, only undertaking to reach 3.6% by 2010, even though it is the site of Europe’s greatest geothermal energy resource, and which to this day has not generated a single watt of electricity. Because of this I support the creation of a conference on renewable sources of energy, which would deal with the differing situations of the Member States, and would aim at reaching agreement.It is essential, in addition, that Member States are responsible for ensuring that environmentally friendly electricity can obtain a share of the market, and take into account the administrative, legal, technical, and grid-access obstacles. Greater aid and joint financing is necessary not only from the Union, but also from Member States. The Commission should do everything to ensure that Member States have greater financial access to development, and also that external costs should appear in the price of energy used. It is definitely worrying to note that in the last twenty years spending on research and development in the field of renewable energy has typically reduced at the national and European level. I suggest in the interests of aid that in the 7th EU technology research and development framework programme starting in 2007, research and development programmes on renewable energy should appear as a separate spending item."}

The Islamic regime in Iran is barbaric and brutal. It despises everything that we defend. The Iranian people ask for freedom. They ask for respect and dignity. The Iranian people ask for their fundamental human rights to be recognised, but the Islamic regime would go to any length to crush the people’s strive for freedom – detention, violence, torture and now mass executions. The Iranian Parliament has moved to execute all the tens of thousands of protesters arrested over the last two months. More than 14 000 people – 14 000 people! We must do everything in our power to support the Iranian people. The Iranian people deserve to live in a free, stable, inclusive and democratic country and we must ensure that they trust in our support. Therefore, we must put all the Iranian parliamentarians who voted for mass executions on our sanction list. We must suspend all political negotiations with Iran, including the JCPOA, because we cannot negotiate with murderers.

That is exactly what the report that I am presenting you today is about. By investing in green technologies, renewable energy and sustainable industries, we can really generate a wave of new employment opportunities. I call on this Parliament, the Commission and the Member States to turn the transition into an opportunity for working people to have quality jobs with fair pay and decent working conditions. As Members of the European Parliament, we have the power to shape politics and set the agenda for the next term, and that really means integrating sustainability into all aspects of our policymaking process. It means considering the environmental impact of every decision we make, and by putting the ecological transition at the core of our policy agenda, we can lead the way in building a sustainable and prosperous future for generations to come. EU legislation should encourage quality and sustainable job creation and favour investments with positive environmental and social impacts. Public money should be spent on the public good and that is why I call for a review of the directive on public procurement to ensure that those benefiting companies and subcontractors do support collective bargaining and respect workers’ rights, high-quality jobs, high-quality apprenticeships, decent and equal pay and training. The decarbonisation of the European economy will create new jobs in a renewable energy and circular economy. Meanwhile, existing jobs, like the ones in agriculture or construction, will undergo changes, such as working under extreme weather events. And we need to anticipate and reorganise this type of work and adjust the legal rules accordingly. To anticipate in all sectors, we need all companies to adopt just transition plans negotiated by social partners. The social partners in the German metal industry, for instance, already reached an agreement including working time redistribution with partial wage compensation or the Italian social partners, they collectively agreed to reskill the workforce as part of their decarbonisation strategy. I think it is very clear that there cannot be a just transition without worker representation via the trade unions. Workers really have a very good view on the on the skills that they have already acquired and on the ones that are missing. So access to training, to education, that is really key to prepare the workforce for tomorrow’s green economy, and that really benefits the companies too. I think we also need strong safety nets to bridge the temporary gaps for workers that are in between jobs. And I suggest setting up a tool similar to the SURE mechanism that we had during the pandemic, that would really support workers who lose their jobs in those transitional regions. The green transition also requires proper funding. The investment gap right now amounts to an estimated EUR 520 billion a year until 2030. STEP was not an answer to this challenge, colleagues. We need fresh EU money to mobilise large-scale investments in green technology and in strong public social services. Last but not least, I call on the Commission to ensure diligent and comprehensive social impact assessments for all proposed legislation assessing the socioeconomic impact and with consideration to jobs, skills, competencies, working conditions in all different countries, regions, sectors and companies. Colleagues, this report is, of course, the result of many fruitful discussions and exchanges with my colleagues in the EMPL Committee, and I would really like to thank them for their commitment. We have the chance to ensure that working people are at the forefront of this transition. Let’s make it happen."}

The feeling of powerlessness was such that Europe was forced to react, and it did so for the good of everyone, because the big winner of this summit was the euro. This triumph has revived the hope that Europe is emerging from its paralysis, moving from thought towards action. Ladies and gentlemen, it was essential to adopt short-term measures at this summit, in order to guarantee financial stability, along with long-term measures, in order to solve the Union’s shortcomings. In this case, immediate action was essential in order to continue working towards what is important. The imperative result was to send a message that the euro is a joint, irrevocable and irreversible project. Ladies and gentlemen, we welcome such important decisions as giving the European Stability Mechanism the facility to recapitalise banks directly, which will break the vicious circle between banking debt and sovereign debt; incidentally, the current Spanish Government has always advocated this theory. It will also help in terms of intervening in markets to support the public debt of the countries that are fulfilling their public deficit and reform commitments. These decisions were necessary in order to guarantee financial stability, which must be the European Union’s highest priority in the short term. Ladies and gentlemen, this is not the time for some countries to resort to nationalist maxims and throw up obstacles. As I have already said, it is the time to support Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, Spain is providing and implementing, in record time, the most ambitious reform agenda in the history of Spanish democracy, which includes major employment reforms. It is also carrying out a financial reform, based on complete transparency, all of which demonstrates its commitment to fiscal consolidation and hitting its deficit targets. We also welcome the decision to launch a process for greater economic integration, using four building blocks: banking union, fiscal union, a common economic policy framework and enhanced democratic legitimacy. Mr President, the history of first the Community and then of the European Union has always shown that, not only do we overcome crises, but also we emerge from them stronger. I am delighted that, once again, we have achieved this."}

I have visited Damascus and the greater Damascus region two years ago. Immediately after that, I have talked to Nathalie Loiseau in order to implement especially the recommendations of international organisations active on the ground in Syria, especially United Nations organisations such as FAO or the Red Cross and others. I had the privilege to talk to – on site – those who had a clear impression on how humanitarian aid works and how it would not work. It works locally, it works regionally, it works when it addresses small and middle-sized enterprises and entities. It works when it addresses civil society and especially the education sector. This is also something we have implemented into this very report of the European Parliament on Syria. Secondly, I want to emphasise that the vast majority of refugees around the world are today Syrian refugees and the vast majority of them – around 80%, as experts tell us – want to go home. They would wish to go home and to have proper dwelling in their very home country, Syria, again, but they are reluctant to do so because they are afraid of violence due to the various tensions within society. Of course, on top of these threats is the Assad regime itself. It’s a threat to the world, it’s a threat to the region, it’s aligning with the ones who are threatening Europe such as Russia and others. This is also what the report obviously addresses, including, among final remarks of the report, also, the Aramaic language, which is a minority language – it’s about to disappear on this planet.

No one can doubt the feelings of all those present at the recent tragic events of last week. This is shared by the Council. We agree that we have a moral responsibility to do all we can to ensure that such a terrible incident does not happen again. The extraordinary migratory pressures in the Southern Mediterranean constitute a shared European challenge that requires solutions at a European level. We cannot expect those Member States which are most directly affected to shoulder the burden alone. Therefore we will, of course, continue to consider this issue as a shared responsibility. I have already set out numerous areas where the Council is taking action, in close cooperation, of course, with the Commission. But we accept that our action needs to be intensified and the tools available to us must be used to their full potential. I would like to highlight the particular importance of the Eurosur system, which will provide information in real time on the situation at external borders, thereby enabling enhanced cooperation between the relevant agencies. This is due to be voted on by this House tomorrow and should enter into force in December. Eurosur already made a difference last week in Lampedusa. Cooperation with third countries also has to be further developed, as was stressed by many of you. The activities of Frontex have been strengthened but, clearly, the events of last week show that we should never be complacent and there will always be more that we can do. Yes, I echo all those who spoke up for more solidarity, for more European solidarity. Speaking concretely, in the Frontex regulation there are specific provisions allowing the agency to assist Member States in circumstances requiring increased technical and operational assistance at external borders, taking into account that some situations may involve humanitarian emergencies and rescue at sea. As part of the Hermes operation, all the assets present in Lampedusa were immediately sent to the place where the accident occurred. Frontex is cofinancing two coast patrol vessels in Lampedusa which took part in the search and rescue operation. Additionally, Frontex cofinanced fixed-wing aircraft from the Italian coastguard sent to the area to provide aerial support to the search and rescue operation. Following the dramatic accident near Lampedusa, Frontex sent out a call to see which other Member States will be able to participate with possible reinforcement. Work is in progress in Frontex in order to prioritise its activities and release additional funds for sea operations in the Mediterranean. A significant number of you mentioned the need for a comprehensive migration and asylum policy in the EU. Reacting to this I would like to express hope that the Commission-led task force agreed on yesterday will effectively address in a comprehensive way the most urgent migration policy issues that you have raised, and come up with proposals and next steps to be taken by EU Member States and institutions. Let me close by assuring you that the Presidency will work very closely with the Commission to maintain a focus on this issue. Especially bearing in mind what Mr Coelho was saying, this is what features very high on this Presidency’s priorities list. We will not cease in our determination to put in place all those tools and means to ensure that the tragic events of last week are never repeated."}

Slovenia was the first country of former Yugoslavia to join the European Union. This stands, and should stand, as an example and a role model for the Western Balkans. And I must congratulate Slovenia on its great integration process that you have just described as a great example for the whole region and for all Europe. Secondly, congratulations on your new president, the first female president, despite she is not from our political family. This is always a very positive and progressive step towards equality, and that should be here naturally, point of order. We have all have some concerns, including on rule of law, which we must share and which is also the point of these debates. First, Slovenia itself has suffered from internal border checks before. But now we hear that you may consider introducing internal border checks of your own after Croatia joins Schengen. This would send the worst possible signals, especially after the council rejected the accession of Romania and Bulgaria. If it happens, the European Parliament will be ready to scrutinise any individual violation of our freedom of movement in Slovenia or elsewhere in Europe. Second, there are some concerns regarding the rule of law. We are paying close attention to the changing of laws ruling the media landscape in Slovenia, in a rather unusual and urgent procedure. And let me tell you that the resignation of the interior minister after allegations of political pressure regarding the police is also troubling. We have so often criticised recent developments in Spain or even in my own country regarding concentration of the power of police. I have to mention this case here as well. Does this not trigger a rule-of-law alert when we speak about interference in police commands? Finally, Slovenia is an example in the support to Ukraine in the current war in humanitarian, financial and military aid, as you have pointed out. However, it is concerning that the Members of a European Parliament that support your government did not support the resolution of this House recognising Russia as a regime sponsor of terrorism. How do you assess this reluctance to support Ukraine in all possible ways? Your fellow Slovene Slavoj Žižek, famously satirised the geographical divisions in Europe by pointing out what separates the Balkans from Mitteleuropa. But those divisions must be behind us. The Sava or the Danube do not separate us. Just like that, the Dnipro does not divide Ukrainians. Europe is large enough for us all. Europe is more than a continent; it is an idea. And it is also an idea in Slovene and loved by the Slovenians. Even though today we meet in Strasbourg, let me recall a small piece of Brussels: near the Schuman roundabout, not too far from the European Parliament stands a memorial with the first line of your national anthem, Žive naj vsi narodi. God’s blessing on all nations. In this difficult winter, in these difficult times, let these words, these Slovenian words, this anthem by the great France Prešeren echo throughout Europe."}

However, the EU backstop proposal ignores one of the core principles of that agreement: the principle of consent. Let me make it clear once again in this House: there can be no borders – and certainly not those imposed by the European Union – within the internal market of the United Kingdom, or interference in its constitutional framework. Great Britain is Northern Ireland’s largest market place, where we sell more than in the Republic of Ireland, the rest of Europe and the rest of the world put together. Equally, 70% of everything that comes into Northern Ireland for consumers and the manufacturing process comes from Great Britain.

We cannot leave the people of Afghanistan on their own. We cannot leave the women and the children; we cannot leave the people living in the rural realities of the countryside. There’s a huge drought also in the country. I very much believe that the time will also be soon when we have to judge the 20 years of the war against terrorism.

Territorial cohesion – like economic and social cohesion, in fact – is a very telling example of that. What these objectives lack more than resolutions and strategies is a general political and macro-economic framework, as well as concrete measures to promote and implement them. Unfortunately, the policies that the European Union has been pursuing have brought about not cohesion but greater asymmetries: economic, social and also territorial asymmetries. There is a very real risk that these asymmetries will become even greater in future, as a result of the even more restrictive implementation of instruments such as the Stability and Growth Pact and the serious constraints that it imposes. This is a very real risk, given the inadequacy of Union budgets, which fall far short of what is needed to put territorial cohesion and economic and social cohesion into practice. What is more, these funds are also often unfairly distributed. Even though mountainous regions, islands and sparsely populated areas differ from each other in their own particular ways, they all struggle with a number of perennial difficulties and problems that they have in common. Some common policies have, I repeat, made these problems worse instead of solving or mitigating them. That is also the case with the common agricultural policy and its successive reforms, the profoundly negative consequences of which need to be addressed and corrected. The specific features of the socio-economic fabric of these regions and their productive systems make them vulnerable to the market deregulation that the EU has been pursuing. We have made a number of proposals to remedy this situation and promote economic and social development in these regions. We need to help mobilise their intrinsic development potential by supporting local production, by stimulating local and regional markets, and by stimulating and increasing public and private investment in productive activities in order to maintain job levels and to create more jobs with rights and fair wages. Nor can we forget that some of these regions, such as the island regions, often complement each other in terms of their production and markets. We must learn to make good use of such complementarity and enhance it. We must also recognise the added difficulties they face in accessing Union programmes and financing in areas such as research and development. We have to apply positive discrimination to these regions to improve their access. A topic discussed here today – the prevention of natural and man-made disasters – is also relevant. We must acknowledge the fact that these regions are more vulnerable to disasters and that disaster prevention needs to be reinforced, as the report we adopted here today points out. Once again, we sound a warning that we have voiced on several occasions: these regions, especially the outermost regions, must be kept among the convergence targets so as not to aggravate a series of structural weaknesses from which most of them still suffer, as in the case of the autonomous regions of Madeira and the Azores in Portugal."}

Gender mainstreaming, as we all know – or at least those of us who are in favour of it – is a globally accepted strategy for promoting gender equality. Gender mainstreaming is not an end in itself, but it is a strategy, an approach and a means to achieve the goal of gender equality. Gender mainstreaming involves ensuring that gender perspectives and attention to the goal of gender equality are central to all – and I would really would like to reiterate this – activities: policy development, research, dialogue, legislation, planning, implementation and monitoring of spending programmes and projects themselves. In 2019 I think it is unacceptable that, although the population of the European Union consists half of women and half of men, the composition of this House of the European Parliament does not mirror this balance, as only 36.1% of all MEPs are female. As the standing rapporteur for the gender mainstreaming report, I therefore encourage the European political parties and their party members to ensure a gender-balanced representation of candidates for the elections of this year’s European Parliament election by means of a zipped list or other methods such as parity lists. The same goes for the Secretariat of the European Parliament. Although women constitute 59% of the staff of this Parliament, they are still under-represented in all ranks of management, and the number of women in senior management positions has even decreased since June 2017, while the number of women in middle management roles increased only slightly. I regret that female representation in Parliament’s key decision—making positions at political and administrative levels still remains low and I urge Parliament to work towards a gender-equal distribution of decision-making positions. I am very confident that the pool of very capable women eligible for such posts is in fact big enough to successfully fill the vacancies when they arise. We need to change the conceptual and behavioural attitudes towards a culture of equality. Moreover, the European Parliament must live up to its values and promote inclusiveness. This report calls for an active inclusion of the rights and the well—being of the LGBTQI community. The European Parliament must pay attention to the rights of all gender identities. On the fight against sexual harassment, the report emphasises that sexual harassment is a serious crime, an extreme form of gender-based discrimination and one of the biggest obstacles to gender equality. I strongly regret the slow and inadequate progress in the implementation of the recommendations of Parliament’s resolution from 2017, such as mandatory training for MEPs and staff on preventing sexual harassment and the setting-up of a task force of independent external experts to examine the situation of sexual harassment in the European Parliament and the functioning of its two harassment committees. In this context, I would like to stress once again that gender equality is not just a women’s issue. In fact men may have a greater responsibility to work towards it as a group with collectively more power and influence in the European Parliament than women. A strong continued commitment to gender mainstreaming is needed in order for the European Parliament to support the promotion of gender equality at all levels. Therefore, I really hope for your support and a positive vote tomorrow."}

That’s why the backlash on the women’s position is a canary in the mine, not only on the question of women but on the whole state of society. And there are lengthy experiments and research showing that when women suffer, societies are on the way to limiting democratic rights, limiting the welfare state and limiting other aspects of freedom. Women do not have the choice or the liberty to ask whether they are discriminated against as women or for other reasons – because women make up more or less half and half of workers, entrepreneurs, emigrants or disabled people. So women face multiple discrimination. And yes indeed, we in Europe have seen a backlash throughout the last years, especially in some Member States.

It is championing to be the first or the second in chemicalisation, in water consumption, in waste problems and in CO2 emissions. Should I continue? And what is the problem with the textiles is that basically everything goes wrong with the textiles. It is from sourcing to the whole processing of the materials, and we know all the social and chemical and other problems there. And it is up to very short use of the textiles itself and then the very unproper discarding of that material. And when you add up that with the extremely increased use of the model fashion and textiles, we can see a blowing catastrophe just in front of our eyes. So because of that, I would like to thank and congratulate the Commission and Commissioner to coming up with this textile strategy that the Parliament has been calling for several times. And I hope that with this strategy, the Commission would set vital requirements and then the voluntary action. We need them both. And let me describe very briefly a couple of those. We need to act on the sourcing and to put the regulatory framework what is sustainable sourcing on the quality, durability, and longevity of the materials. We need to set up a proper life-cycle analysis to support it. We need to prolong the use, and there the target should be that the hub of the textiles by 2030 should be served as services. We need to reuse, recycle and then refibre back to the use, so with the target with the tenfold resource efficiency. And to conclude, there needs to be minimum regulation on social and environmental standards and the neglect should be criminalised. But we need the voluntary actions, that is the Disclosure Regulation, due diligence, taxonomy and CSRD that the textiles should be included in."}

This could entail the introduction of a unified set of criteria established by EU legislation. An important step in ensuring access to life-saving medicines for all European citizens should be the adoption of an EU list of essential medicines. Furthermore, we should address medicine shortages by establishing strategic stocks, but also by encouraging member states to collectively negotiate prices when purchasing equipment and medicine.

I find this report extremely timely and appropriate because in fact, on one hand, it provides evidence that cohesion policy works and demonstrates the value of a place-based policy. My particular thanks to the rapporteur for highlighting the results of cohesion programming during the period that is now finishing. The report also identifies the challenges ahead, in particular demographic change, climate change and continued geopolitical instability, as well as areas of improvement and modernisation of the policy to be able to respond, to give the adequate answer to these challenges. So, I think this report makes a vital contribution to discussions on the future of the policy. Indeed, your report, I would like to underline four elements in this report, in relation in particular to the role that we all have to address of modernising cohesion policy. First, enhancing the performance of the policy and a related second area that touches directly simplification and the ease of implementation, which by itself requires improved administrative capacity so that you can have another mode of managing the policy. We see potential to increase effectiveness at the same time as accelerating implementation and you build on lessons learned from other European instruments, such as the Recovery and Resilience Facility funds and plans. But of course, there are certain elements that we cannot disregard or change in cohesion policy and this is the identity, main principles, long-term objectives of the policy – and they have got to be preserved. A third aspect: enhanced links with reforms, better governance, administrative capacity need, in fact, to be seriously considered. As the report points out, some Member States’ regional and local authorities, as well as other stakeholders, lack sufficient capacity to design, plan, implement, and this capacity is a precondition for performance-based programme management. Moreover, to maximise impacts, investments must in fact be combined with reforms. Reflections should cover the scope of the reforms needed, the role of the European Semester and how Member States can play their part, their role. A fourth element: we are considering increased flexibility for emerging challenges. Different challenges affect each region differently and cohesion policy intervention during recent crises has been indispensable. Otherwise, there would have been the collapse of a lot of regions and countries. From the emergency response to COVID-19, to the STEP initiative, we have shown that Europe is close to the citizens, is in a solidarity mode with the citizens also in times of crisis, or in particular in times of crisis, while promoting European competitiveness in a fast-changing world. As you know, together with you, all of you, we have done our utmost with the policies’ long-term objectives not being shifted or changed to balance the policy and to adjust the policy to give adequate responses to this crisis. We continue to support long-term investments. It’s are the key drivers of economic convergence, get regions out of development traps, make sure that in fact and in reality, no person is forgotten or feels forgotten. In the coming weeks, the Commission will publish the Ninth Cohesion Report. This will raise key questions for the future, providing solid data, solid information, which is also an important basis for discussion. So, your contribution is absolutely essential. Thank you very much for it and I look forward to the exchange that will follow."}

Solidarity is a core value upon which the Union is built. The EU Solidarity Fund was created to provide EU solidarity by contributing to post-disaster relief in Member States and accession countries confronted with devastating natural disasters and major public health emergencies. Since its creation, the fund has mobilised close to EUR 7 billion for interventions in a hundred disaster events in 24 countries. A recent evaluation of the EU Solidarity Fund confirmed the effectiveness of the fund and the synergies between the EU Solidarity Fund and other EU policy instruments for disaster risk management. It also concluded that the fund brings clear EU added value and demonstrates EU solidarity in action. However, we cannot ignore that climate change is causing more frequent and intense weather and climate-extreme disasters in Europe and around the world. The past two years have provided a sad truth. Heatwaves, drought, forest fires, floods, earthquakes, are breaking records every year in both rate and intensity, with a disastrous impact on human lives, the economy and on ecosystems. Between 2002 and 2019, the fund was mobilised for 91 interventions. In comparison, in 2020 alone the Commission received 31 new fund applications. For the first time ever, the fund was mobilised not only following natural disasters, but also in response to the COVID-19 public health emergency. Of these, 19 Members States and three enlargement candidates will receive fund assistance by the end of 2021 to respond to the COVID-19 public health emergency. And this year, the Commission has so far received eight EU Solidarity Fund (EUSF) applications for support to recover from natural disasters. We should also be concerned about the increasing intensity and impact of the disasters. Last year, Croatia received EUSF assistance of over 680 million, the second highest amount ever paid by the fund for emergency and recovery operations after a natural disaster. This year the application from Germany for the devastating floods in July reported the biggest total direct damage ever presented in the history of the fund – EUR 29.2 billion. This is the damage suffered by Germany alone. Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria and Luxembourg also submitted applications following this summer’s natural disasters. The Commission has started the assessment of these applications in order to have a comprehensive overview of the needs. Based on this assessment, the Commission will consider all possible options within our instruments to allow the EUSF to continue to deliver on EU solidarity to Member States. The increasing number and scale of natural disasters in the last two years, as well as the need to provide assistance in relation to the COVID-19 public health emergency, has put a severe strain on the resources set aside for the fund, as agreed by the legislators in the 2021-2027 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). Moreover, contrary to the Commission’s MMF proposal to restore the EUSF envelope of EUR 1 billion, the instrument was integrated into the new solidarity and emergency aid reserve, with the total amount of EUR 1.2 billion shared with the emergency aid reserve. Mobilisation of the resources is today more challenging as it also covers other EU internal and external emergencies, while calls are likely to grow, as has been painfully illustrated this summer. The EU cannot be asked to choose between competing needs for relief and recovery at home or abroad. We must be in a position to provide support to both Member States and those in need elsewhere. In any case, the Commission remains determined to support Member States to speed up assessment and application procedures and deliver on EU solidarity with the EUSF."}

He spoke of turning Europe’s turbulent history into one of a profoundly fair and peaceful order, based on the principle of equality and cooperation by all sides, where understanding and general consensus guide Europe. Four years later, he lived to see his dream fulfilled with the enlargement to the Czech Republic and nine other European countries. My country joining the European Union was one of the proudest moments in my life. The barrier between the East and West – gone. Yet the discussion continued after enlargement: new versus old Member States, EU-10 versus EU-15, east versus west. Twenty years on, I am truly glad that there is no longer an ‘us’ or ‘them’, but only a ‘we’. We still have national interests, but we are all equal members of the same club. We are one European Union. Twenty years on, we must not give in to those that wish to take us back. We must not give in to those who speak of Brussels or Strasbourg as something to fight against. If you don’t like it, then reform it – but we must refuse to go back to nationalism. We must refuse to go back to the divided Europe of our parents. Havel’s dream didn’t end with enlargement 20 years ago. He dreamed of the continent as a whole being united. Now is the time to continue his dream, and I look forward to welcoming more members to our club, where dialogue replaces hate and wars. I am a proud Czech and I am a proud European. Twenty years on, I am proud to be both at the same time, and for this I will always be grateful."}

Respect for women’s rights and gender equality is part of European integration. However, as you know, the EU has no competences on abortion policy and cannot interfere in Member States’ policies in this area. According to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the definition of health policies and the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care is primarily the responsibility of individual Member States. Having said that, I would very much hope that Poland will not stop progressing towards gender equality but rather continue to build on the genuine achievements of the past years. Poland has, for example, introduced an electoral gender quota system. It has also made great reforms improving work-life balance, such as the extension of the duration of basic maternity leave to 20 weeks, the introduction of paternity leave, parental leave arrangements and an increase in the accessibility of preschool education. Even though the electoral gender quota has increased the number of women on electoral lists it has not translated into a considerable increase of women’s actual participation in politics, yet. The gender gap in employment rates continues to undermine the potential of many economies in Europe. In Poland it is particularly high among older women leaving the labour market earlier than men, and among young mothers because of still insufficient access to childcare. In the 2016 country specific recommendations Poland was encouraged to step up efforts to increase female labour market participation. So, let me conclude by restating our genuine commitment to women’s rights and gender equality and my hope that we can continue to work with the Polish authorities to achieve further progress in the area. I am looking forward to today’s discussion, and at the end of this discussion I will enjoy the privilege to add also a few words from my personal side."}

The EU’s energy transition and climate policy framework. All actors, including the Commission, have a role to play. We are currently completing the analysis on the upcoming 2040 climate target communication, but it is clear that we need all available technologies to play their role to the maximum in order to meet our climate objectives. In other words, SMRs have a clear potential in the policy mix in this time frame and beyond. We will carry out the work on SMRs, including the EU’s Industrial Alliance on SMRs in an open and transparent manner. This is important for public engagement and trust, but also to ensure that all stakeholders that adhere to our policy priorities can participate in a collaborative way. The Commission is looking forward to continue playing a strong role to facilitate cooperation, further initiatives, support research and innovation, develop skills and European industrial capabilities and capacities. Our utmost priority will remain that the new SMR designs are developed in a way to ensure the highest standards of nuclear safety, radiation protection for workers and citizens, responsible management of radioactive waste and spent fuel, and the reliable non-proliferation regime. This is an absolute must. To conclude, there is still a lot of work to be done, but our clear aim is to be able to design and deploy SMRs at the beginning of the next decade. We are now in a good position to proceed in this direction in the framework of an EU industrial alliance. The Commission will also continue close cooperation with the co-legislator to finalise, in the nearest future, the legislative initiatives relevant for SMR technology and nuclear-power production at large. This includes the electricity market design reform and the hydrogen and decarbonised gas market package to strengthen the business case of clean energy investments, and the Net Zero Industry Act for the European ecosystem for cleantech. I am looking forward to seeing your report adopted by the plenary and continue our cooperation on that basis."}
{"id": "e021eba5-9caa-45a8-8077-28220baacb3e", "text": "Thank you very much, Mrs Svensson, for your very moving introduction on this extremely important subject. Combating violence against women is a very high priority for the Commission, as is shown by the gender equality strategy. There is still, as you show, a very big problem of violence against women in Europe, and for that reason, we are working on focused actions to address this issue. We will develop a clear and coherent policy response to tackle this problem in Europe. I welcome your report, Mrs Svensson, and I welcome this important initiative; it provides the possibility to cooperate, exchange views and create synergies between what the Commission is doing and what the European Parliament is doing in order to define future action in this area. A number of points that you raise in the report are actually covered by ongoing and planned actions of the Commission on combating violence against women. To maximise our impact, we are focusing on concrete actions in an area where we have a clear legal basis to act in the Lisbon Treaty. In the forthcoming victims’ rights package, we will, notably, address the protection of particularly vulnerable victims such as women, but also children. This package will be presented next month. Every victim of crime needs assistance in the aftermath of a crime and to cope with any proceedings that follow. Women are, of course, particularly vulnerable if they have suffered violence in their home – rape or sexual abuse, stalking or other kinds of gender-based violence. They need to be treated with respect and knowledge when they come into contact with people and the justice system. These women also need specialised support and protection and should be given access to justice and compensation. The current legal framework in the EU does not provide for a minimum level of treatment for victims throughout the EU irrespective of where they have been victimised, and that is why the Commission intends to act to strengthen the position of victims in Europe. We are thus presenting, as a first step, a package of legislative measures on the rights, protection and support of victims of crime and the mutual recognition of protection measures. Specific focus in this will be given to vulnerable victims such as victims of sexual and domestic violence. The Commission will also provide for the mutual recognition of protection measures, which will benefit especially victims suffering repeated violence from a spouse, partner or member of their close family. With this package, the Commission will make sure that in Europe, no woman crossing the borders and benefiting from a protection measure – be it of an administrative, civil or criminal nature – is left behind. Our package will set out a general framework, which would then be completed in the course of this mandate by other instruments focusing on the specific needs of certain types of victims. For instance, the Commission is concerning taking stronger action to combat female genital mutilation, as you also mention in your report. In parallel with our actions in the criminal justice area, we will work for the empowerment of women, awareness-raising and the collection and analysis of statistics on violence against women. The Commission will draw on the work by the European Institute for Gender Equality, which will collect and analyse data and statistics on this subject. To conclude, I would like to underline that the Commission is currently providing important financial support to prevent and combat violence against women, particularly through the DAPHNE III Programme, the work of European NGOs and public authorities."}

Two-thirds of Europeans see the euro as a good thing. The starting point for this report has been the observation that the international role of the European currency remains below its potential and that it is in our strategic interest to reap all possible benefits from a stronger role of the euro in the world. For far too long, the use of the position of the euro internationally was entirely left to market forces. Recently we have realised that with supportive policies the euro can become a currency that is widely welcomed, used and trusted all over the world. Geopolitical shifts and international trade challenges, including the disruption of value chains, technological developments, digital transformation, the rise of China’s economic power, geopolitical challenges to multilateralism, and last but not least the pandemic and its consequences, have triggered reflection and action on building the necessary resilience of our economy. The President of the European Commission in his State of the Union address at the end of 2018 highlighted the strategic importance of the euro, and the need to ensure that the single currency plays its full role on the international stage. After the elections in 2019, the European Parliament accepted my proposal to start working on our position on this issue. The Commission, in its communication issued on 19 January 2021, encourages wider use of the euro as part of a broader strategy to enhance the Union’s leading role in the global economy and its governance. Parliament’s report comes just before the euro summit on Friday 26 March, set to discuss how to enhance the euro’s weight as an international reference currency. In preparation for the summit, the Eurogroup contemplated last week how the international role of the euro can contribute to the EU’s open strategic autonomy and resilience, while boosting the EU’s openness and global engagement. The ECB too has departed from its historically neutral stance regarding promotion of the euro. Beyond its active contributions to the discussions in preparation to launch the digital euro, the ECB has taken actions attesting its support for the euro currency’s international role. An example here can be the extension of swap lines to a number of central banks outside the euro area. The global nature and severity of the pandemic have highlighted the world’s interdependence, bringing new impetus to the project. The push for action towards a stronger international role of the euro comes in the moment of high relevance of policies enhancing the EU’s geopolitical resilience and its new trade agenda. But a stronger role for the euro internationally will also provide additional choice to market operators globally, contributing to the stability of international finance and trade. It will lead to deeper and more liquid European financial markets, providing for more reliable access to finance for European businesses and governments. It will make the world economy less vulnerable to monetary shocks. As mentioned, the European currency can facilitate building a multipolar, international monetary system. However, the decision to use a currency is ultimately determined by market participants’ preferences. Our policies should be supporting market-driven shifts in this direction. The report proposes, in this context, focusing on a number of particularly relevant policies governing areas of international trade, financial services, capital markets and payment systems, but also climate change, the digital transformation, energy, and foreign and security policies. The report leaves no doubt: the euro is irreversible as a European currency and a strengthened international role will allow the EU to improve the well-being of citizens and promote an international system based on multilateral cooperation and good global governance."}

First of all, I would like to thank the European Parliament for having organised a successful public hearing on 25 May, and on this occasion I also want to congratulate again the organisers for collecting 1.2 million signatures in record time. We heard from them their arguments. We listened very carefully. The organisers had a chance to present their initiative and the different Members to express their views also, and today’s plenary debate gives me and my colleagues preparing the Commission official reply another opportunity to listen carefully to the contributions and interventions from various Members. This initiative reminds us that animal welfare is a significant concern for European citizens and a longstanding principle in European legislation. It requests to strengthen the animal testing ban under the Cosmetics Regulation. It then addresses all legislation requiring animal testing for chemical safety assessments, REACH legislation on plant protection products, biocides, pharmaceuticals and others. Lastly, it extends to basic and applied research, including biomedical research, training and education. On the first issue, related to cosmetics, it is important to note that the Cosmetics Regulation already bans animal testing for cosmetics products and ingredients for the safety assessment requirements of that regulation. However, other legislation may still require animal testing, for instance to assess hazards to workers’ health or the environment. Regarding chemical safety assessments under different legislation, I would like to underline that already today animal testing is allowed only as a last resort. However, as experts of agencies like the European Chemicals Agency or Member State authorities confirm, we are not yet able to fully identify all hazards to health and the environment without some animal testing. The good news is that we have seen significant progress in the development of non-animal methods in recent years. The workshop on new approach methodologies that the European Chemicals Agency organised with the Commission and stakeholders in June undoubtedly showed that the funding of research for alternatives to animal testing is highlighted in the initiative. I want to emphasise that the Commission already actively supports the development of such methods through research funding. Over the past two decades, the European Union has allocated over EUR 1 billion to more than 300 research projects. Today’s exchange of views will feed into our reflection. We will present our general conclusions, as well as the actions that we intend to take in response to the three objectives of this initiative, in our communication later this month. I wish you a fruitful discussion."}

The Commission welcomes the European Parliament’s contribution on the important topic of small—scale fisheries in the EU and future perspectives. As you rightly recall in your report, the small—scale and coastal fishing fleet represents nearly 75% of all fishing vessels registered in the EU and nearly half of the employment in the fishing sector. This clearly shows the important socio—economic role of this sector in European coastal communities and the outermost regions. Your report calls for a broader definition of small—scale and coastal fisheries in a horizontal piece of legislation, like the common fisheries policy. Due to the size of the sector, the geographic differences across Europe and differences in the type of fishing conducted, this would be a difficult task. The existing specific references in the European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund already facilitate access to EU funding for small—scale fisheries, while the references in the control regulation are specific to control needs. I agree with your draft report that small scale unfortunately often also means small voice in the value chain and in relation to other stakeholders. I also agree that a large part of the solution lies in a better collective organisation of small—scale operators to have a more collective weight and a louder voice. This is why the Commission adopted the rules for the advisory councils in 2022 to ensure more participation of small—scale and coastal fisheries. This is also the reason why the Commission strongly encourages Member States under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, as well as the new European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund, to support collective organisation of producers, organisations and fisheries local action groups. I want to underline in this context that Member States have the possibility to provide preferential rates of support under the new EMFAF, and they should use this possibility. Support can also be applied for the installation of storage, freezing and refrigeration infrastructure on small—scale vessels as long as they comply with the conditions for vessel modifications, as defined in the Regulation on the European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund. However, and here I need to be clear, the Commission cannot agree with establishing new criteria in relation to the fishing capacity. In most Member States, there is available capacity within the capacity ceilings set by the Common Fisheries Policy, and this could very well be used to increase the capacity of vessels in order to improve safety, living and working conditions on board or for more energy efficient propulsion systems. Again, our Fund foresees financial support here. So, the Commission could not agree more with your report that young fishers need to be attracted to this important economic sector and that upgrading skills and training play a crucial role here. In this context, the financial support available must be pointed out again, and I would like to encourage Member States to use it. We have taken careful note also of the other proposals contained in your report to improve the situation of small—scale and coastal fishers who are indeed part of Europe’s fishing and maritime heritage. The Commission will carefully examine them. But my main message today is that the Commission fully supports all initiatives to strengthen the role of small—scale and coastal fishers in parallel to our continuous and joint efforts to further reduce the environmental impact of those fisheries. I thank you for your attention. I look forward to hearing your views. I gave you the message of my colleague Commissioner Sinkevičius, of course, but everything you will say will be duly noted, and I will pass your message to him."}

It is a good example of efficient and constructive cooperation between the institutions. The Commission proposal has two main parts. On the one hand, it envisages the closure of the Joint European Venture programme and, on the other hand, makes a few changes to the European support mechanism for start-up capital for technology companies, called ETF Start Up. This mechanism provides risk capital for launching technology companies. The proposed closure of the JEV programme is the result of an evaluation of the programme which concluded that it has not achieved its objectives. Demand has decreased and the impact in terms of job creation is limited. I think that this proposal sends a clear message that both Parliament and the Commission are prepared to close ineffective programmes that do not achieve their objectives. It is better for the Commission to devote its financial and human resources to financial instruments for small and medium-sized enterprises which have a greater impact, for example the SME guarantee facility and the ETF Start Up mechanism. The changes proposed for this support mechanism will make it flexible. The changes will improve the availability of funding and start-up capital for companies that are up to ten years old, compared to five years old currently, if they are working in particular sectors such as life sciences. This reflects the fact that product development and the experimental phase can be particularly long for those companies and that, during that time, they need access to risk capital in order to continue their business. The Commission’s proposal also refers more explicitly to the eligibility of funds invested in companies carrying out research and development activities. This highlights the fact that the European support mechanism for start-up capital is open to funds used for small and medium-sized enterprises that are particularly active in research and development. I will conclude by saying that these changes to the support mechanism for start-up capital should help in achieving both the Lisbon objectives and the objective of 3% GDP for spending on research and development. I am therefore pleased to see that Parliament supports the Commission’s proposal. It therefore goes without saying, Mr Rübig, that the Commission accepts all the amendments from the European Parliament, i.e. Amendments Nos 1 to 5."}

We agree about large tranches of the content, but we have two problems. On the one hand, we will not be able – and I very much address this point to Mr Turmes – to build up pressure together on the Member States and on the Commission if we continue to hold an ideological debate where the subject is always nuclear energy. That is the sticking point in today’s votes. We have reached a compromise on the SET plan, and that compromise is that we have specified the criteria according to which we want to support this, and those criteria are clearly defined, namely sustainability, competitiveness and security of supply. We have said that we want to work without limitation to specific technologies and we are again having an ideological debate about nuclear power, which is a discussion that can be held, but which ultimately makes no sense in the context of the SET plan. I concede to you in respect of the question of what the SET plan can actually achieve. Has the question of to what extent the Member States are prepared to find a coherent energy policy approach actually been resolved? What the Council has put in place today is a series of platitudes. The problems, really, are not so much what we lay down in the SET plan, but how the assorted funds for research, innovation and the money from the SET plan, the issue of demonstration facilities, the issue of the transposal of European directives at national level – how all of this interacts. We are currently at a point where we have to say really clearly that we can produce another SET plan and that we can adopt another SET plan, but what we need now are tangible measures. That being the case, we should not always be arguing over the details. We should increase the pressure on the Commission and the Member States so that something happens in terms of implementation."}

It is a known fact that in farming, cereal prices affect approximately 80% of the price of animal feed. This, in turn, affects roughly 70% of production costs. It is impossible to increase proportionally the sale price of meat to the producer. Livestock farmers have no contact with the end consumer, but deal with the processors who always have the option to import. At the same time, processors pass on their large profit margin which they have been accustomed to hitherto in the sale price. Unfortunately, this period is coinciding with a general economic crisis and the decline in the population’s purchasing power is also affecting livestock production. There is another factor to consider. At a time when farmers will find it difficult to provide feed for their animals during winter, a huge number of them will choose to slaughter their animals, which will help prolong the crisis for more years in the future. In order to maintain domestic prices at a reasonable level and ensure animals receive the feed they require, intervention stocks need to be released. I am therefore pleased by the announcement made by Commissioner Cioloş today. I share the view of my fellow Members who stressed the importance of growing new genetically modified organisms to provide cheap feed for animals and reduce the dependency on imports. Last but not least, today’s debate is closely linked to the future of the common agricultural policy. We need a strong common agricultural policy which is well financed and well managed, and which can accommodate both structural development and modernisation measures, as well as market and direct support measures."}

This year the priority theme is the empowerment of rural women and girls, while the review theme is participation in, and access of women to, the media and information and communication technologies and their impact on, and use as, an instrument for the advancement and empowerment of women. I am happy that, as in previous years, there will be an EU delegation representing the team of Europe led by my colleague, Neven Mimica, with Members of the European Parliament as part of the EU delegation. The position of women and the full enjoyment of their human rights by women and girls are still areas of concern for us in 2018. Progress on these topics is by no means a given. In fact, we have seen attempts to go backwards and to call into question once again the rights of women and girls, including in Europe. We discussed these questions thoroughly, together with many stakeholders, during the Annual Colloquium on Fundamental Rights in November last year. In this global context, the EU is one of the world leaders in gender equality. We are by far the biggest investor. With the EUR 500 million EU-UN Spotlight Initiative, the latest commitment to collaborate with other international organisations in combating violence against women, a global alliance is being formed. And, to mitigate gender—based violence in humanitarian crises, the EU has taken over the leadership for the call to action on protection from gender-based violence in emergencies. Furthermore, the EU will strive for the session to adopt agreed conclusions that take into account the particular reality of rural women and girls world-wide, that challenge social norms and gender stereotypes, that promote equal economic independence for women and men, that promote women’s participation in decision—making at all levels, and that strengthen the prevention of all forms of violence against women and girls and the protection of its victims. I would like to thank Parliament for drafting such a comprehensive document that captures the priorities related to this year’s priority team very well. The Members of the European Parliament have an important role to play, complementary to that of the Member States and the other EU institutions. I am very happy to be here today, and I welcome this opportunity to listen to your views on priorities for the upcoming session."}

We have just heard it talking about a union of values, but when we view the actions of the Commission in the handling of this particular situation in Catalonia, it looks more like a union of selective values. The double standards of the Commission is something that leaps to the eye. All are equal, but some are more equal than others. Everything depends on who is involved. Let us be honest, ladies and gentlemen, if it were another Member State rather than Spain, the consequences and the rhetoric from the Commission would have been far harsher. I want to be clear: I do not believe the EU, or the European Commission for that matter, strengthens the EU’s unity through infringement proceedings, or triggering the articles of the Treaties or all the political point-scoring and suchlike. This polarises the debate and pushes Member States and its voters further away from the EU. I urge the Commission to practice the virtue of self-restraint, but consistently, not selectively. Coming to Catalonia, I do believe – a rather simple-minded observation but always worth repeating – that significant progress can be made through patient negotiations. Whether and how soon an effective resolution is possible in Catalonia, I do not know, and very few people, if anyone, in this Chamber knows that. I wish to be honest with our Spanish colleagues: riot police and violent scenes have not helped but shocked and, whatever your intentions, those scenes will continue to be a part of the image of your government for some time. Let us admit it, the handling of the crisis was appalling. It was really appalling. What are the next steps to be taken? Whether it involves constitutional reform, or the granting of a referendum or international mediation, the role of the Commission is probably as an intermediary or a go-between. It is for the Spanish Government, Spanish society and the Catalonian people to decide for themselves. However, I do caution that the passions of those citizens in Catalonia seeking a new settlement is unlikely to fade away by simply drowning out or ignoring the voices of dissent. To sum it up, the action of the riot police, the conspicuous silence or the Aesopian language of the European Commission will not make the problem disappear."}

We have already debated this issue of quality of jobs and especially also the skills shortages in a competitive social market economy this morning. It’s true that skills shortages are not only undermining Europe’s competitiveness and resilience, they are also a risk for social cohesion. In a recent Eurobarometer survey, two out of three small and medium-sized companies said that labour shortages are holding back their business, preventing them from investing and creating more jobs. The economic cost is huge. It is estimated that about 2% of GDP is lost due to skills shortages. When I say job creation, I mean creation of good jobs. Having the skills needed on the labour market will precisely allow for access to better jobs. The main answer is to train people and train them now. We need it for the digital and the green transition. We have even dedicated one EU headline target on skills, namely that 60% of adults train at least once every year. This is not new. Lifelong learning goes back to Jacques Delors, who already emphasised this need even before becoming Commission president, and in his famous Stockholm speech at the ETUC conference, he announced the right for permanent training that has materialised in principle number one of the European pillar of social rights. To mobilise and encourage actions at all levels, especially in Member States and at local level, the Parliament and the Council established the European Year of Skills. The 2 000 events organised across Europe so far show that there is a strong awareness of how important lifelong learning is. Of course, we do not start from scratch. The 2020 European skills agenda has laid out a roadmap on how to boost skills policies and has led to several very concrete actions. We have the tools and funding available, with EUR 65 billion supporting training through the European Social Fund Plus and the Recovery and Resilience Facility. The 2022 Council recommendations on individual learning accounts and micro-credentials promote more adult skills development, which should be supported by good guidance to both workers and companies, especially small enterprises. The 2023 Council recommendation on digital skills underlines the need for better strategies to support the development of digital skills at all levels and for all groups. Also, skills partnerships are an effective approach. Those established under the pact for skills have already upskilled 2 million workers. They are bringing together all relevant stakeholders in each industrial ecosystem. We should also recognise that sometimes, skills are available, but they are not just visible. People develop useful skills at the workplace through volunteering, live experience, sport, leisure. Validating these skills will help people to find jobs and companies to create and fill jobs. Recognising skills and giving them value is as important as developing skills. Companies that need skills should better identify the skill they need. Those skills may very well be already available among their staff. Also, when recruiting new staff, it is important to identify what applicants can do – not only look at their degrees or certificates or the job title of any previous experience. Recruitment should also be based on skills first. This helps companies find people with the skills they need, also among groups who are less represented on the labour market, such as women, the low qualified inactive monetary groups, older workers, people with disability. Skilled migrants can contribute to address labour shortages, such as through the skills and talent mobility package, but this must be part of a holistic approach. The message of the European year of skills is clear: skills shortages can be addressed if we recognise that skills matter and we need to develop them throughout our lives. Skills indeed matter. They are an investment, not a cost. This is the basic message of the year, and I’m grateful for the continued support by your Parliament in the common endeavour."}

However, as always with the short-term presidencies, when they are good, they leave us with a bitter feeling of a somehow unaccomplished job. Therefore, I believe the most important question now is: how and what could we further build on the achievements of the Swedish Presidency? The first thing is the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty. A treaty is never enough for solving a problem. Political will is always needed in order to enhance it properly but, in this case, I think that we need even more than will. We need courage and imagination – imagination to fill the gaps or to clarify the ambiguities of the treaty. Therefore, I hope that, starting with the experience it has accumulated, the Swedish Presidency will still remain involved in supporting the building of the new institution which the Lisbon Treaty has created, namely the permanent – or long-term – President of the European Council and the office of High Representative with the External Action Service. One of the priorities of the Swedish Presidency was, of course, the management of the economic and financial crisis. This was very important. Against this background, I think two phenomena which are quite threatening have been observed: firstly, the temptation of national protectionism and national egoism, and, secondly, the economic and social disparities between our Member States and the lack of economic, social and territorial cohesion within the European Union. Should we call into question the wisdom of enlargement? Certainly not. These disparities were already there before, and interdependence is valid not only within the Union but globally. Therefore, these disparities were able to undermine or to put in jeopardy the stability of the whole continent and the Union. Therefore, I think that enlargement made it possible for the new Member States to cope with these disparities better inside the Union, for the profit of all Members of the Union. But the conclusion is as follows, and I will end here. I believe that the next step is to pursue bolder and more substantial policies of territorial, economic and social cohesion in Europe – and not fewer policies of this kind – together with bold reforms, financial and economic reforms which would allow us not to repeat the crisis, and, certainly, with policies for post-crisis rehabilitation. In this context, the last statement of the Commission concerning economic support for eastern countries, as well as the readiness expressed by Mr Barroso to debate the 2020 Strategy, should be commended."}

The EU must be a strong force, the Community method must contain strong positions and we need strong institutions. I agree with you wholeheartedly there. But actions speak louder than words. As far as the post-Nice agenda is concerned, what you said means more Europe, not less Europe. It means more integration, not less integration. In other words, the proposals which you make will need to be specified and some will need to be reworded. One often has the impression, when it comes to the separation of powers, that forces are at work which seek to weaken Europe. It is up to you, I think, to say what we want to do together, what we must do together in the 21st century in order to make Europe strong. Then the debate on the separation of powers will be a completely different debate from what we sometimes hear now. Strong Community institutions: this issue also needs to be specified. The issue here, as far as I am concerned, is the application of parliamentary democracy to policy on Europe. This does not just mean discussing the role and function of the national parliaments, it also means making the European Parliament even stronger. We have still not been granted a number of rights which we need when it comes to legislating, setting the budget and controlling the Commission. If we want strong Community institutions, we need to re-examine the Council and the Commission. The Commission should be a sort of government, not just the Council’s secretariat, and the Council should then be seen as a committee with the ability to take decisions. As far as the method is concerned, you said rather cryptically that the convention has advantages and disadvantages. I should like to know what the disadvantages are and for whom. I was a member of the Charter convention. I saw no disadvantages. I saw only advantages. I therefore call on you to state in your Gothenburg report that the new method will be a new convention to prepare the Intergovernmental Conference. One last word on the timetable. I too think that 2004 is wholly inappropriate. We can wrap this up by the end of 2003. A new Treaty of Rome would then perhaps be the right basis for European elections in 2004 and a good basis for completing enlargement."}

My criticisms are not, of course, directed at his report, but instead concern the mindset with which the matter of culture is addressed by the Council and by the Commission. The Constitution would have given us the foundation for tackling a common cultural policy, based on the diversity of cultures and on mutual acceptance of the principles of freedom and of human rights. However, the Constitution did not go so far as to grant culture the status of a real Community policy, which was an argument for not voting in favour of it. The objective that should be achieved by increasing our knowledge of others is precisely the objective sought by all of our countries. Doing away with the fear of others is a prerequisite for attaining a life led in peace in a society of genuine cultural pluralism. Learning about differences: that is the objective of a common cultural policy. Among the Commission’s objectives, the mobility of persons leads me once again, Commissioner – and I am well aware that you yourself are not the person with responsibility – to ask the following question: where, in all of this, is the work of the Council on problems related to social security, taxation and status, which prevent people from being truly mobile, not to mention its work on the lack of financial resources to support real exchanges between the new Member States and the old ones? The Commission has held on to intercultural dialogue as an objective. It was high time this problem was highlighted. Greater synergy between education and culture was the subject of one of the amendments tabled by our Parliamentary committee. Greater synergy is necessary, and all the more so given that, since 1998, and under the UK Presidency, employability – a terrible term – has been part of European texts as a principle for education. It is a mistake to think that greater emphasis on culture in school curricula would be a waste of time. Creativity and a lively mind are qualities that are acquired through an appreciation of the arts, just as a culture of tolerance and the prevention of violence are founded on respect for artistic feeling and on the cultivation of the senses. As from now, the budget for 2006 has been revised downwards, to EUR 36 million instead of EUR 38 million. I note that, despite the fine speeches made by Mr Barroso and by all the group leaders in front of a small number of active contributors to the cultural sector, their words are not about to be followed up by actions. Point duly made."}

Indeed this is not the first time I had the opportunity to discuss with you this very important topic. I would like to use the opportunity to reiterate the points which I have made previously. Combating all forms of violence against women and young girls is a core element of the respect for fundamental rights. These crimes have no place in the Union, and the Council is clear on zero tolerance of violence against women. The Istanbul Convention is a comprehensive framework on violence against women and domestic violence. It constitutes a concrete tool to eradicate all forms of violence against women, protect its victims and prosecute the perpetrators. Finally, it contributes to the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women and promotes equality between women and men. All 28 Member States have already signed this Convention, and 18 of them have already ratified it. The Council has, on several occasions, encouraged those Member States who have not done so yet to ratify the Istanbul Convention. On 11 May 2017, the Council adopted the decisions on the signing of the Convention on behalf of the European Union. Our Presidency is carrying on the work on the conclusion of this important instrument. This includes reaching agreement on internal rules in the form of a code of conduct for the implementation of the Convention. According to the EU-wide survey on violence against women conducted by the Fundamental Rights Agency in 2014, one—in—three women, which means 33%, has experienced physical and/or sexual violence since the age of 15. One—in—five women, which means 18%, has experienced stalking; every second woman has been confronted with one or more forms of sexual harassment. Violence against women cannot be seen as a marginal issue that touches only on some women’s lives. Last but not least, gender-based violence also has a significant impact on economies and societies as a whole, for example in terms of health, legal and social services. In 2014, the European Institute for Gender Equality has estimated that the cost of violence against women in the European Union could amount to billions, or to be more precise, EUR 109 billion per year. As President Tajani strongly affirmed, ‘the struggle for the elimination of violence against women is a fight that each and every one of us must take part in. It is our duty to stand up for women by drawing awareness to this injustice.’ The Council has repeatedly expressed its commitment to preventing and eliminating all forms of gender-based violence. We all know that only our joint efforts and a message of unity will help to improve the situation of all women and girls in Europe."}

Allow me first to express my gratitude to the rapporteur, Mr Bowis, and the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for all their hard work and support on this important and urgent proposal. The SARS emergency in the early spring of 2003 served as a sharp reminder of the need to accelerate the further development of our capacity to deal with health threats. The current epidemic of avian influenza in Asia – that we have just discussed – with its potential risk to public health, reinforces the need for prompt and effective action. The existing Community network for surveillance and control of communicable diseases is a solid basis on which we can build – to enhance cooperation between the Member States, the Commission and international organisations, in particular the World Health Organisation. We need to have the means at our disposal to respond to emerging health threats based on the best scientific advice, in the shortest possible time. Establishment of the centre marks the shift from ad hoc cooperation to structured coordination through a focal point, giving clear scientific leadership. In some recent cases, in response to WHO requests for help, we have seen teams from different Member States investigating the same phenomena with slightly different methodologies, sending samples to different laboratories, with each of them reporting separately. This divergence would end with the creation of a scientifically reputable centre with the authority to act at Community level on matters such as surveillance, networking of expert laboratories or mobilising outbreak investigation teams. The Commission’s text takes into account budgetary rigour and respects the Member States’ responsibilities on public health. At first, the centre's core task will be to deal with communicable diseases from whatever source – deliberate or adventitious. The question of extending its mandate subsequently should be addressed on the basis of experience. I very much hope that we can reach a speedy agreement between the institutions – during first reading – to enable the centre to become operational as soon as possible."}

We need strong governance – economic, social – in the European Union. We need, obviously, strong solidarity and we have managed, up to now, to show this strong solidarity. I think we have learned a lesson from the COVID crisis that a strong economy can only be a resilient economy, an economy that adapts rapidly and that also creates the resources to respond to challenges. The big challenge we have now is certainly how we can stabilise the recovery. There will certainly be an impact on growth. There will be, or there might be, an impact on employment. Some weeks ago, we noticed that it was about job shortages, qualified labour shortages. Now, maybe, given the situation and given the increases in prices of energy and of food, we might again head for more difficulties on our labour markets. So we have to be ready to respond to that. Therefore, the semester is an essential tool to have strong governance. This governance has to be economic, certainly, fiscal, yes, but also social. These are the two sides of the same coin if we want a resilient economy and a resilient society. It has been said that we now also need stability in our society. During the COVID crisis, the most vulnerable paid a high price and we have to avoid the price of this terrible war being borne by the most vulnerable. First, on refugees, I think here there is a need for very, very strong and rapid solidarity. We do not know the numbers. It has been said that it’s about two million today and there might be seven, eight or more million people who have to be received and welcomed, and who have to get all the support they need, especially in those Member States who are the ‘frontline’ Member States. The Commission yesterday adopted a package, as a first step, with the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund, of EUR 400 million, and with REACT-EU, which can make available about EUR 10 billion which, in a very flexible way, can be devoted to taking care of the people arriving. We have a proposal on a new system, which is similar to the coronavirus response investment initiative (CRII) system, and which we call ‘cohesion’s action for refugees in Europe’ (CARE), which also allows Member States to take funds from the Cohesion Fund to allocate to the reception of refugees. This is a duty, and there is a particular duty, because you have, Mr Geuking, spoken – rightly so, by the way – on children. There are, among the refugees, hundreds of thousands of children who have lost everything. And there’s a duty now to take care of these children, as it is a duty, by the way, to take care of all children. I fully agree with you. Therefore, in a few days, we will have the national plans on the implementation of the child guarantee and we also have to include in this child guarantee the children of refugees. It is not conceivable that these children have no education, that they will be nowhere, that they will be the lost Ukrainian generation, which is, by the way, the aim of the dictator in Moscow. Therefore, we have a strong responsibility to give them – again, as for all children – the right support, the right education, the right care. Yes, this war is a challenge for poverty. In the European Union, we still have a high degree of poverty. More than 96 million people are at risk of poverty. We have taken an important commitment by reducing it by at least 15 million, including at least 5 million children, and it cannot be that the war will increase poverty in Europe. This is a challenge. We have to find the right responses, the right resources, the right policies and the right investments in our economies, but also in our social systems."}

It responds to what we established at the beginning of the 7-year Multiannual Financial Framework as our main priorities: growth and jobs. In order to allow for more growth in the European economy to generate more jobs, we are investing the money which we have in innovation and infrastructure. It is those areas which will make the European economy stronger. We are also giving support to students, with EUR 50 million more for the Erasmus programme, and to SMEs and young entrepreneurs through investing EUR 50 million more into the COSME programme. As the Commissioner also said, we have not forgotten about farmers, and I want to see that, in addition to these additional priorities that we have had, we also respond to current and new challenges, making Europe safer again. We are strengthening Europol and Eurojust and we want to stop illegal migration to Europe and manage the refugee crisis which we have been tackling. The negotiations were difficult. We managed to agree, but to my colleagues in Council I also want to say that, if Europe is expected to deliver in the coming years, especially in 2018, Member States have to understand that, if there are new priorities and new demands vis—à-vis the budget of the Union, then of course fresh new resources are clearly also needed. What we are delivering this year is a good budget under difficult circumstances but, if we are expected to deliver more next year, then of course more resources are needed. To conclude, I would like to thank the main rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs, with whom we have worked in a good spirit.

I also conclude that it is being handled with too much restraint. It is not the case, as Mr Őry emphasised previously in this discussion, that we know too little about what domestic workers in Europe do. On the contrary, we know so much that there is an urgent need for regulation. Between 5% and 9% of all employees work in private households. This is the worst paid group of employees in Europe, with the fewest rights and the largest proportion of illegal workers. Action is urgently needed in this area and this includes the European Commission. The situation we currently find ourselves in will not be improved by the free movement of workers. For this reason, the initiative in this International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention is very welcome and deserves our support. I would like to comment on four points. Firstly, there are gaps in the definitions in the ILO Convention. If domestic workers cannot work occasionally, sporadically or not on an occupational basis in this sector, then the opportunities for circumventing the legislation are already in place. Secondly, there is an urgent need for mandatory employment contracts in this area. Thirdly, we must have not only sensible, generally binding minimum wage regulations, but also equal employment rights. Fourthly, these workers must be covered by a statutory social security obligation, in particular, given that this is a minimum wage sector. I am pleased that Mrs Berès has called in her statement for a campaign to introduce standard working conditions. This is a good thing. We must ensure in future that work which does not pay a living wage is outlawed by society and is no longer tolerated."}

That is the alarming figure taken from the excellent report by my colleague from the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, Mrs Maria Carlshamre. Faced with the escalation of violence against women and the way in which it is becoming an everyday phenomenon, there is only one firm, appropriate answer: zero tolerance whether the violence takes place in, or outside, the marriage. Europe has, moreover, faced up to its responsibilities in order to combat this form of violence affecting women from every social group. Under the Daphne II Programme, EUR 50 million are being dedicated between 2004-2008 to protecting those women among us who are most at risk. This is a symbolic amount because we are well aware that, if the prevention and victim support policies are to be effective, then they have to be carried out on a national basis. It is therefore alarming to learn that, each year, between five and ten million children see and hear inhuman acts of this kind take place. It is therefore crucial that the 25 national criminal sets of legislation from now on consider children, like their mothers, to be victims. Our society has for too long underestimated the seriousness of violent acts against women. We must put a stop to this cowardice."}

Amendment 2 refers to a single seat. That is what we have. Our single seat is Strasbourg. We should hold to the Treaties we have concluded. That goes without saying. When we come to the issue of a House of European History in Amendment 4, then it is our duty to show our younger generations how important it is to work for this peace every day.

We all want the same thing for the Syrian people, for Syria, for the region: an end to the conflict; a lasting peace for the Syrian people; the possibility of a voluntary, safe and dignified return of refugees; and stability for the region as a whole. This goal can only be achieved through a real political process, as set out by UN Security Council Resolution 2254. The dire regional situation is a stark reminder that unsolved conflict can easily degenerate, and that we all have a strong interest in supporting the aspirations of the Syrian people. Let me also emphasise again that Syria and the Syrian people remain a priority for the EU and will continue to do so, and the EU will continue to raise its voice for the only path to sustainable peace for Syria: a political solution in line with UN Security Council Resolution 2254. We will remain firm in our position on Syria. There will be no lifting of sanctions and no reconstruction in the absence of a serious and credible engagement from the Syrian regime in the political process."}

What we have here is an act of misdirection by the Troika inside this Parliament – the EPP, the Social Democrats and the Liberals – to absolve themselves of all responsibility. Her speech could be summed up with the phrase: the Troika told us to do it. Is that really the best excuse that the Labour Party and the others here can come up with? Did the dog also eat your election manifestos? Did the Labour Party have nothing to do with the cuts to health, education and social welfare? Did they have nothing to do with the household tax, the property tax, the water tax? In an Irish context these reports means Fianna Fáil, the Greens, Fine Gael and Labour being able to wash their hands and say – and I quote from the report – ‘the bail-in of senior bondholders was not an option available to the Irish authorities’. The only problem is, it is just not true. It was a political choice, made by the Troika, yes, but also made by the establishment parties across Europe, to burn Irish working-class people instead of hitting the bondholders and speculators. These reports accept the very same logic. It is the same logic of Bono, patronisingly telling us that the Irish people bailed out the Irish people. No, Mr Hewson. On Planet Earth the Irish people, with the treacherous connivance of two governments, were bullied, threatened and coerced in order to bail out billionaire bankers and bondholders by the very people he described as heroes. Confronted by the humanitarian catastrophe created by the Troika policies, we need more than criticisms of the legal basis of the Troika. We need a rejection of authoritarian neo-liberalism. We need to refuse to pay the debt that is not our debt. We need public investment to create jobs and we need to build a Europe for the millions, not the millionaires."}

The agreement that was recently reached on the multiannual plan for fish stocks in the western waters and adjacent waters is an important one. Not only because it has proven difficult to find agreement on such plans in the past, but because it is a strong agreement that will help to ensure the sustainable exploitation of stocks in Belgian, German, French, Irish, Spanish, Portuguese and, yes, United Kingdom waters. We are all aware of the challenges faced by the fishing sector in the western waters. Fishers in my constituency in the southern coast of Ireland face significant challenges due to the obligations of our fisheries policies targeting specific species in this region. It is difficult due to catches being mixed and this, combined with the landing obligation and inability to discard catches, makes life difficult. I am pleased, therefore, to see this agreement incorporate all relevant stocks into a single management plan, replacing the existing single species which would allow for some flexibility for fisheries. Sustainable stocks are vital and that’s what we have to include. Finally, I welcome the agreement on recreational fisheries. Any restrictions on recreational fishing should be based on scientific evidence and objective criteria. This is a welcome inclusion in the agreement. I congratulate ‘mon ami’ Mr Cadec and the Commissioner, Mr Vella."}

The sector accounts for about 82% of the country’s total export revenue and most workers in the ready—made garment sector are young women, as you said, from rural backgrounds. Ten years ago, the deadliest accident in the history of the modern garment industry –and one of the worst industrial accidents ever – took place in Rana Plaza in Bangladesh, leaving 1 100 people dead and at least 2 500 grievously injured. This was not the first tragedy of its kind and, sadly, not the last. Others have happened since. Rana Plaza and the other industrial accidents suffered by Bangladesh brought home the urgent need to establish a culture of workplace safety in the country’s garment industry and beyond. Much has improved in the last ten years, however more needs to be done to ensure that clear standards, guidelines and accident reporting protocols are understood and implemented at all levels. Compliance with core labour standards and national legislation must be improved, including coverage of compensation, contracts, gender inclusivity and working time. Better access to social protection for workers across Bangladesh in all economic sectors is crucial. Further strengthening of the capacity of the safety committees, labour inspectorate and trade unions will be integral to this. Labour rights must be respected in order to foster an environment where trade unions can operate freely and without harassment, where improved social dialogue between the government, employers and trade unions takes place. It is imperative that we build upon the lessons learned and progress made in the ready—made garment industry to enhance industrial safety in other priority sectors to avoid such a tragedy repeating itself in the future. Occupational safety and health must be a priority."}
{"id": "97311227-4457-45a4-801c-a276fe930fc9", "text": "Mr President, Madam Commissioner, colleagues, there are two things we need to make clear, very clear today. First, Parliament is a strong supporter of the participation of New Zealand in the Union’s programmes. We are strong supporters of other countries like the Faroe Islands, Canada and South Korea participating in our programmes. The resolution we will adopt today makes it very clear we have no problem with those countries and their participation in the Union’s programmes. However, and this is the second point, Parliament will not accept that its democratic prerogatives are disregarded. The Treaties are clear: only Parliament’s consent can make the Union plausibly accept to set up a committee under the international agreement with the power to amend certain parts of the international agreement. I repeat: only if Parliament gives consent. The Court of Justice also made clear that Parliament’s consent must be meaningful. The Council and the Commission have chosen to ignore this constitutional reality. They have insisted on setting up association agreements for the Union programmes with a completely new category of third countries, which cut the parliaments out completely. They have asked the Parliament to sign a chèque en blanc. Therefore, the Parliament cannot give meaningful consent to these agreements, and we have communicated this clearly to other institutions for almost two years. It’s an insult of the services, and I addressed specifically the Secretary-General that she is refusing to take up interinstitutional dialogue, although Parliament’s President had asked for that a year ago. So this resolution is our last attempt to change the course of the Council and the Commission. The only step left us after this is to start denying consent, which will kill these agreements. We do not want to do this: researchers involved in Horizon should not become the victim of this interinstitutional fight, but we protect our democratic prerogatives. We will do that, whatever it takes. So I would have to read you the following question, also in the name of my co-rapporteur, Mr Lacapelle. As regards international agreements dedicated to the participation of third countries in the Union programmes, the Commission is asked the following: given the broad powers allocated to the Joint Committee established under the draft agreement between the EU and New Zealand – including its ability to adopt and amend the protocols on associations to Union programmes without further parliamentary involvement – how does the Commission intend to ensure that Parliament retains oversight and power of consent as regards future associations to the Union programmes? Secondly, can the Commission commit to increase transparency of the implementation of the agreements via regular and detailed reporting in order to enable Parliament to exercise its oversight rights? Will the Commission structure future agreements in a way that guarantees the respect of Parliament’s prerogatives concerning agreements on any association to a Union programme? Will the Commission launch negotiations on an interinstitutional agreement that completely abides by both the letter and the spirit of the Treaties in full respect of the principles of parliamentary scrutiny in the implementation of the association agreements, including as regards the adoption and amendment of protocols? And, I may add, this might be today a conversation of connoisseurs, and we might not have a lot of participation because it’s very specific. Believe me, there will be a lot of presence if Parliament is going to deny consent to these agreements."}

The debate is very timely, as was said by the author himself, in view of the decision of the UN General Assembly to convene a high-level meeting on HIV and AIDS in June. As the world tackles the COVID pandemic, the devastating AIDS global pandemic continues. While the world focuses on overcoming the direct impact of COVID and laying the ground for recovery, the secondary health impacts, the disruptions to essential health services, including with respect to HIV, hepatitis, tuberculosis and malaria, are deeply concerning. We all know that HIV is fuelled by inequalities and that it disproportionately affects vulnerable and marginalised populations. Worsening inequalities increase the spread of HIV as do armed conflicts and natural disasters. We need to work collectively to ensure that our response to the COVID pandemic tackles these inequalities, preserve the gains achieved during the last decade and secures access for key populations to the essential services. This is why the Commission welcomes the new global AIDS strategy for 2021-2026, sharing many of its priorities, not least the focus on tackling inequalities, gender equality and human rights. Putting people at the centre, involving communities and ensuring that we learn from COVID, in particular to build sustainable health systems is fundamental. This is why we welcome the broad principles, reiterated commitments and strong calls contained in the resolution tabled today. The European Union is actively involved in the negotiation of an ambitious and progressive new political declaration for the upcoming high-level meeting on HIV-AIDS. As with previous United Nations political declarations, the most sensitive issues will require delicate negotiations. On behalf of the European Union, the Commission is recommending the inclusion, not only of new prevention, testing and treatment targets, but also of specific targets related to stigma, discrimination and human rights. I am convinced that the fight against HIV is closely linked to breaking down barriers, including working on legal issues ensuring equitable access of key populations to services and treatments and strengthening the overall health systems, accompanied by an enabling environment for sustainable financial resources, notably domestic. The response to the HIV pandemic also requires further focus on adolescent girls and young women. Our new Gender Action Plan 3, puts the fight against gender inequality at the centre of our action. The Commission is a long-standing supporter of the fight against HIV. We are a major contributor to the global fund with EUR 550 million for the period 2020-2022 and we attach high importance to fighting HIV-AIDS globally. Our more recent support to the work of the act accelerator, notably its cross-cutting health system connector, is paramount to mitigating the indirect effects of the COVID pandemic and to strengthening the preparedness and response to current and future pandemics, and this includes HIV-AIDS. The upcoming high-level meeting provides an important opportunity to remobilise the international community with respect to the fight against HIV-AIDS, and you can count on the EU’s engagement."}

I would like to warmly thank you for your deep knowledge, your commitment and your clear values. Corruption undermines our economy, society and the rule of law. We must fight corruption, especially now when we are mobilising public money for recovery and reforms. I hear Mr López Aguilar, Ms Yoncheva, Ms in ‘t Veld and many of you asking me and the Commission to do more. I hear you and I agree. The Commission does not have the competence nor the capacity to carry out criminal investigations, but the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO) and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) have. In December last year, OLAF recommended the recovery of EUR 6 million due to abuse of power in the Bulgarian Ministry of Interior. But the Commission can also do more. We now have again an annual Anti—Corruption Report, as part of the annual Rule of Law Report, and one important step will be to make this Rule of Law Mechanism sharper by introducing recommendations. I will also say to Mr Freund that of course the Commission stands ready to support Bulgaria or any Member States to design and implement mechanisms to fight corruption and money-laundering, and to have proper safeguards for public prosecutions. In July, the Commission proposed the setting up of a new anti-money laundering supervisor agency, and we will, of course, continue to prioritise the actions under the EU strategy to tackle organised crime. Corruption in relation to the Union budget is also to be investigated. As I said earlier, the European Public Prosecutor’s Office is now in place. I would like to thank you again for this debate. I must say that, as long as corruption undermines the rule of law, we have not done enough. I’m glad to see once more that this House shows how strong an ally you are in the fight against corruption."}

The murderers, but also everybody else involved – the middlemen, the masterminds, those providing political cover – must be identified and prosecuted. Impunity must end in Malta. But how can we expect justice when there is no rule of law? How can we trust in an independent investigation as long as the Prime Minister continues to cling to power? Can we really expect the same people that have been obstructing justice for the past 26 months, the same people that have been demolishing the memorials that were erected in honour of Daphne’s memory – can we really expect these people now suddenly to lead the charge in seeking justice that the family of Daphne so deserves? How naive are we exactly supposed to be? The Venice Commission already concluded over a year ago that the wide powers of the Prime Minister create a serious risk for the rule of law, and we see that risk now in Malta day after day after day. And every minute longer this Prime Minister stays in the centre of power is a minute where justice can escape for us.

{"id": "3bc88409-8cea-4c48-8a2a-cff597a56b76", "text": "Madam President, this House regularly discusses freedom of the press both within and outside Europe and, like you, I remember a heated debate in the autumn of 2009 on freedom of the press in Italy, among other countries. Was it legitimate for us Europeans to point the finger at Italy and its prime minister Mr Berlusconi, or was it a domestic matter in which the rest of Europe should not have been interfering? In July, the Representative on Freedom of the Media of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) published her report. She did dare to point the finger. The OSCE has done the rounds in Europe and drawn our attention to the following countries. The murder of a blogger, Socrates Giolias, in Greece, the murder of a journalist, Grigorijs Nemcovs, in Latvia, the new media law in Hungary that encroaches on the autonomy of public TV channels and decreases the available media, and the presidential supervision of public channels in France by President Sarkozy. I have just heard something about Romania, and then, of course, there are the latest developments in Italy whereby a law prohibits investigative journalists from reproducing wire tapped materials. Turkey, Serbia, Albania and Bosnia-Herzegovina, too – countries with the prospect of joining the European Union – receive reprimands from the OSCE, and rightly so. A big stick remains for these countries, however: membership of the European Union. Freedom of the press is one of our Copenhagen criteria. Therefore, benchmarking is used for accession countries, and it is distressing to see that the European Council does not consider these benchmarks applicable to itself. If it were up to the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, Italy would indeed lose its voting rights in the Council whilst it persisted in the repression of journalists and whilst everything continued to be in the hands of a single businessman and prime minister. To return to the subject of media concentration, however, the fact that commercial and public media in Italy are in the same hands is well known, but let us not forget that there are also Axel Springer, Bertelsmann, Rupert Murdoch and, in the Netherlands and Belgium, Christian van Thillo, who owns a very large number of newspapers. A free press is crucial to our democracy, and it is up to the European Commission to present us with a proposal to combat media concentration, precisely because we have to take the OSCE seriously."}

The interesting development is that precisely through Parliament’s efforts, we have achieved a clear shift in the Council’s position and in the position of the Commission. Commissioner Šemeta, I am pleased that you have truly had a Damascene conversion on this. That is pleasing, and I fully endorse what you have said here. However, the background that we must discuss is how we can implement this tax as generally and widely as possible on a broad tax base and as evenly as possible. That is precisely what we are wrestling with now. In other words, the issue is whether we will succeed in including as many taxpayers as possible, based on the proposed residence principle, so as to avoid competitive disadvantage. Parliament is therefore proposing that we supplement the Commission’s proposal by adding the principles of issuance and ownership. I would be pleased if you could examine this very carefully. In my opinion, and in that of many experts, this makes the tax stronger; it ensures that it can be levied more evenly. Of course, we immediately start now to debate its scope of application. Firstly, currency transactions. We propose that currency transactions, which is where the whole debate on a Tobin tax began, be included. We do not find the legal concerns that have been asserted in that area to be very convincing, nor do various experts. We think it is right to include these currency transactions. My second point concerns the issue of high-frequency trading. In this case, we are proposing that transactions that are not completed are also included in the tax base, since in practice, the number of instructions that are not executed, not completed, is 15 times as high as the number completed. The tax would then also put a brake on high-frequency trading. I regret to say that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) is currently proposing a general exemption in this area for the undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS). Exempting the large investment funds market would be a serious mistake. It would mean that banks would simply establish a UCITS and thereby be able to carry out their transactions without any tax liability. That would be doing ourselves a real disservice. On the matter of pension funds, I regret to say that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is now also proposing that pension funds be exempted. That, too, is a mistake in our view, because studies show very clearly that the less frequently that pension funds trade, the more profitable they are for their investors in the end. The OECD has just presented such a study. Implementing this tax consistently will not penalise them. Finally, I would also like to address the Council. The Danish Presidency – a country with a high tax burden, including on the factor of labour – should have a particularly great interest in progress being made in the area of the taxation of capital yields. So far, you have achieved little in this respect. Please would you get moving on this, and instead of looking into alternatives, just go with Parliament’s proposals."}

Next week will mark the second anniversary of the entry into force of the Regulation establishing the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) which, as you know, has been our pandemic crisis response tool. Today, the implementation of the facility is in full speed, with a total of over EUR 144 billion already disbursed to Member States. At the same time, we need to acknowledge that the implementation of the ambitious National Recovery Resilience Plans is taking place in a challenging context, already mentioned by many of you. Russia’s unprovoked and unlawful aggression against Ukraine has triggered a massive disruption of the global energy market. It is under these unprecedented circumstances that REpowerEU was devised with one clear objective: providing affordable, secure and sustainable energy for Europe. Thanks to its focus on the green transition and resilience, the RRF was put at the centre of the Union’s coordinated response to the unprecedented energy crisis. In fact, REpowerEU showcases the facility’s agility. The Commission would like to thank the honourable Members for their enormous work on the proposal to introduce REpowerEU chapters in the National Recovery and Resilience Plans. After numerous rounds of intense negotiations, we believe that the compromise agreement strikes the right balance between urgency and ambition. One of the key elements is the increased financial firepower of the facility. In addition to the EUR 225 billion of loans available under the RRF, Member States also have access to EUR 20 billion of new grants and up to EUR 23 billion of grant transfers from other EU funds. These funds can be used to finance a wide set of measures, such as investments in the critical infrastructure to increase energy security and reforms, speeding up permitting to accelerate the rollout of renewables. Furthermore, the compromise agreement makes sure that no one is left behind. With high energy prices affecting some more than others, the facility can finance measures addressing energy poverty, providing targeted support to vulnerable households and businesses. The compromise agreement also increases transparency via enhanced stakeholder consultations and also, importantly, the obligation to publish information on the 100 largest final recipients of RRF funds. Having data from final recipients was a longstanding demand by the European Parliament, and the Commission is glad that the two co-legislators agreed to have such a list of the 100 largest recipients of the RRF funds published by the Member States. The Commission will use this information on the RRF scoreboard. This will help transparency. Furthermore, as called for by this House, the proposal effectively encourages cross-border and multi-country projects. Since its inception, the Recovery and Resilience Facility has always been more than just a crisis response tool. Its key feature is transforming challenges into opportunities. The RRF already had the foresight to put the green transition at the forefront of the post-pandemic recovery. Now, with targeted amendments introduced by REpowerEU, the facility will also play a key role in accelerating the net-zero industrial transition. As outlined in the New Green Deal Industrial Plan for the net-zero age, we need to address the structural challenges affecting the competitiveness of our clean tech sector. This is why the Commission encourages Member States to include in their REpowerEU chapters measures such as one-stop shops for permitting for clean tech projects or tax breaks for businesses undertaking clean tech investments. The facility can also finance investments to equip the workforce with skills necessary for this industrial transition. Together with the Green Deal Industrial Plan, the Commission also published guidance to help Member States access the REpowerEU funds, explaining the process of modifying their plans and the modalities for preparing REpowerEU chapters. In this unprecedented context, the Commission is working hard with the Member States to make the implementation simpler and more efficient. The Recovery and Resilience Facility is built upon one core European value: solidarity – solidarity in the face of the COVID pandemic, the energy crisis and the growing global competition in the transition towards a net-zero economy. As my colleague said before your last vote on the proposal, we are strongest when we stand together."}

And, although the subject is China, it of course takes place against the background of some significant developments in Xinjiang in the western part of China. I know that these events have been followed by many Members of this Parliament as well as our respective national parliaments throughout Europe. We have also, as a Council, expressed our concern over the reports on the unrest there and called for restraint on all sides and for the situation to be resolved peacefully. I think it is time for us to say that we attach great importance to human rights. We also profoundly regret not only the loss of life but the destruction of property and everything else that we have seen happening and we can only condemn those that are responsible for it, whoever they are. But let me also take this opportunity to take stock somewhat more widely of our relationship with China, a country with which we have an extraordinary range of complex relationships. In fact, when we decided in 2003 to set up those relationships within the framework of a comprehensive strategic partnership, we were committing ourselves to an extremely ambitious enterprise, and this is very much reflected in the broad and wide-ranging relationship which we have with China today. Complexity of course brings opportunities. It also brings challenges of different sorts. What we have tried to do with this relationship is to open it up to the point where we can discuss frankly and openly any concern that we might have on either side. The basis for such an open dialogue is the shared interest that we have in developing our relationship, our shared interest in global peace and stability. We pursue this through dialogue and through multilateralism. We have the annual summit meetings and we have fairly frequent meetings at the level of foreign ministers. We also have an intense biannual human rights dialogue and then of course sectoral dialogues on different issues, trade obviously being one of particular importance. We also have the annual high-level dialogue on trade and economic issues. As you are aware, in 2007 we also launched negotiations for a partnership and cooperation agreement. Negotiations are progressing but still there is a potential to increase efforts on both sides in these negotiations. We have a very clear interest in developing the relationship with China in all fields, and that entails, as I said, the possibility for an open and frank dialogue, also on issues where our values might be different, and we know that such issues exist, including human rights, including issues like the use of the death sentence; but also to pursue the common interest that, needless to say, we have these days: issues of global financial stability, issues of how to deal with the climate change challenge are important. Also important are foreign policy issues, be that the situation we face over the Korean peninsula with the provocation by the DPIK, or the situation in Burma, where we are concerned, obviously, at what we see happening, but our concern also stretches to the situation in Africa and the need to protect the vital sea routes around the Horn of Africa. I will not go further into this question now, but wish only to underline the concern that we have over developments, without being able to assess those in every single detail because they are exceedingly complex, our hope that they could be resolved peacefully and our readiness to engage with the Chinese authorities in a frank dialogue on these issues, as well as on the broad range of other interests that we share together and that we need to have a dialogue on."}

The feedback has generally been positive, but improvements can be made. However, in order for an implementation report to be accurate, we need facts and figures. Accordingly, my colleagues and I requested relevant information from the European Commission, and I am sad to inform you that several Member States objected to our request. Again, the Council seemingly does not want to cooperate with the European Parliament. Previously, I highlighted that the Council prematurely made decisions before we as Parliament had adopted our position, and now they are denying access to pertinent documents needed for us to exercise our function of political control.

During these few days we have been discussing various issues that are to improve road safety and the quality of transport. Two days ago we were speaking about the safety of pedestrians and cyclists, yesterday we were discussing the transportation of hazardous materials and safe road systems. Today we are considering vehicles themselves, that is, how to make the vehicles used by people on roads within the European Union as safe as possible. For us the goal is clear, which is to enable EU citizens to move about more effectively and make their lives more comfortable but, at the same time, they should feel safer, so that, thanks to our regulations, we can tell our electors, tell the people, that we have made a positive contribution. Specific measures taken by the European Parliament show the importance not just of this House, they also show that European legislation and European institutions bring something positive and tangible into the lives of everyone. We should remember that when we are debating initiatives to make vehicles safer, there are two things to bear in mind. Firstly, it is the car itself and all the systems that we are considering: systems for speed control, for stability control, for maintaining distance between vehicles, all these support systems, together with navigation systems, are all very important things that improve the functioning of the car, which is the tool that is used by those travelling by road. However, we should also remember, and it is appropriate to point this out in these speeches, that, for our citizens, for those travelling by road, the issue of communications is also very important, should there be a tragedy, an accident, or some misfortune. Our citizens should feel confident that, thanks to technical equipment and the systems that we are introducing, they will get help as soon as possible. Both these issues are very important. Both, that means effective information systems so that help can arrive in case of an accident and, at the same time, systems that improve the vehicles themselves. In discussing this report, which my political group supports, we have also to remember its limitations. First of all, when we speak of an intelligent car, we must not forget that a very important part of an intelligent car is an intelligent driver. This is no small matter and the educational issue is very important. We have found on a number of occasions that technological progress was not accompanied by improvements in safety. Why? Because, despite improved technology and faster cars, drivers felt impregnable when driving their cars. Better roads meant they could drive faster. For this reason the issue of education, showing what is useful in modern technology, but also its limitations, and also showing how drivers should not abuse the modern technologies that we, I hope, will implement, is also very important. The issue of market forces has also been raised, as there are no guarantees that the regulations introduced by ourselves, however good, useful, appropriate and beneficial for drivers they may be, will result in an immediate exchange of vehicles in favour of cars that we consider to be safer, more efficient and easier to use. There are no guarantees because there is, of course, the barrier of price. This barrier could severely restrict access to these vehicles. I am not a supporter of systems that involve funding and also, both for the Commission and for all of us, it is something of an intellectual challenge to know what to do, not just to make safer vehicles and better roads, but to make our citizens, the citizens of the European Union, want to use them and to have the financial capabilities needed for this purpose. I would like to thank the rapporteur very much and to express my strong support for this report once again."}

And I think that it is important, especially in this Chamber, to remind all of us that this is the third year of the multiannual financial framework (MFF) – I mean, 23 – but this is our fourth year of this term. So the end of the term is coming. And the question is, how will we be judged? How will we be evaluated? How did we behave facing this completely new situation? I mean, ‘we’ as in Parliament, preparing legislation, and you the Commission. I think how well you are prepared to adapt to the new situation is very important. So when we look at the European Commission programme, we can see, of course, the ongoing processes, the pending elements which we will have to finalize, and we will have the new initiatives which are proposed by the Commission. But there is also the part which is not written in the programme which is the question of the capacity to adapt to completely new, unexpected situations. This is probably next year’s activity. So we will be, as you will be, evaluated for the response to completely unexpected situations concerning the war, climate change, food crises, etc. So that’s why we have to take care of everything that can happen – not only everything that is planned but all that can happen. So that’s why we as the EPP would like to concentrate everything on the jobs, especially the jobs for citizens, farmers, SMEs, businesses. This is also about the functioning of European energy markets. This is also the question of protecting EU citizens from outside threats. So I think this is very important. And the question of how to fight foreign interferences and the attack against democratic values and our way of life. This is for us two basic elements, because when we speak about the social market economy, we are speaking about people. So we have to take care of their life. And we have to take care of the programmes but, of course, take care not to create victims of the programmes. We cannot have people falling victim to our ambitions. We have to be very rational and very clear. Let me finish, Mr Commissioner, by expressing that I found in your documents, for the first time, the expression that you are not ruling out a revision of the MFF. This is the first time we have heard this from the Commission. Up to now, it has been only a ‘review’ or even an ‘ambitious review’. But this is the first time I have read about the possibility of revision. I can keep your promise and we will see how it will happen."}

Perhaps the manufacturers should think about including a priority override function. That is why I am a little late. Commissioner, I am much obliged to you for answering these pressing questions. Forgive me if I repeat myself a little, but I simply want to emphasise a point – I believe that the GMES (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security) programme is one of the two leading initiatives in the European Union’s space policy and is of key importance for the monitoring of the Earth. This, in turn, is an indispensable instrument in the fight against climate change, environmental pollution, disaster prevention and security, sustainable development, mobility and crisis management. GMES was established as a Union programme and will receive funding of about EUR 3.2 billion from the budget until 2013. The lack of a workable financial plan for long-term, solid financial support would probably mean that the costs will rise in the long term. The programme and the associated supply of data could be temporarily suspended or even abandoned entirely. In the final analysis, this could mean that the investments previously made will have been in vain. Europe could lose its independence and technological edge in relation to this important space infrastructure. What is at issue? We are talking about a sum of EUR 5.8 billion for the period 2014 to 2020, admittedly a very large amount of money, but one that offers a very substantial economic benefit. Despite the current budgetary difficulties in many Member States, GMES must be sufficiently financed in the budget and through the financial perspective. Mr Barnier, you wrote us a letter recently. If I might quote you: ‘Europe should not be satisfied with defensive answers to the crisis – however important this may be – Europe must also open up the prospect of new growth for its citizens!’ This idea could be expressed very succinctly. It is possible to drive oneself to destruction through excessive savings. This principle applies in a different context to an important Member State of the European Union. If GMES is to be run on an intergovernmental basis in future outside the budget, so that Parliament would no longer have a say in the project, then, in my opinion, the European space strategy would be doomed before it even began. This is why we are calling for a legislative proposal from the Commission for the long-term administration, financing and implementation of GMES and the embedding of the budget in medium-term financial planning. The Danish Presidency announced conclusions for the Competitiveness Council on 21 February and then cancelled them again because there was no majority in the Council. Some Member States question whether the Council Working Party on Space should be responsible for this project, which I find particularly surprising. Unfortunately, this development in the Council has given rise to two camps. One camp, a group of Member States that fund GMES through the budget, has also written to you. A second group wants to follow the proposal tabled by the Commission. If this stalemate continues, I fear that GMES may fail and that an enormous opportunity will have been lost. This is quite apart from the fact that many millions of euro already spent on the project will have been spent for nothing. The greatest risk, however, is that we will set a precedent, and that the Member States will use this to justify activities outside of the Treaty of Lisbon. I thought we had put these times behind us. I have three demands. Firstly, I hope that we, the European Parliament, will be courageous enough to continue to finance the major projects of the EU, such as GMES, but also Galileo and ITER, through the budget and to establish separate budget lines with sufficient reserves for this purpose. Secondly, I hope and demand that the Commission tables this legislative proposal as soon as possible. Thirdly, I call on the Council to push through reasonable and sufficient funding within the budget and to take the necessary decision."}

But where is this leading? In a competitive single market, the best—endowed regions in terms of infrastructure, geographical and natural characteristics, and institutions attract companies which become European champions and thus attract new enterprises. These areas will continue to grow and new companies will be established. When discussing delocalisation of companies we focus too often on its impact on workers, their families and the region of destination. What happens to the region of departure, its social class and industrial fabric? There is an impoverishment in all sectors. In a single currency area, countries and regions have very few tools to change this trend. Ultimately, other workers and enterprises will relocate from these regions and the process continues, increasing the asymmetries across the EU. New redistributive policy tools are needed, such as a European unemployment insurance. Structures that have been established to ensure the competitiveness of countries are too complicated and bureaucratic and should be adapted to globalisation, without abandoning the European social model. In its industrial policy, the Commission should also strengthen the way to provide technical assistance to help local and regional communities to adapt to social, economic and environmental changes."}

The Commission shares your concerns as expressed in several parliamentary resolutions already adopted. The Commission also welcomes the award of the 2019 Sakharov Prize to Ilham Tohti. While we all knew about the gravity of all human rights violations in Xinjiang, the Xinjiang police files add to the evidence reports and voices we hear from the ground. The leaked speeches, images, documents and spreadsheets shed new light on the brutal methods used by the Chinese Government, seriously eroding the cultural and religious identity of the Uyghur people, justifying mass-scale and indiscriminate actions under the guise of the fight against terrorism. The publication of these documents coincided with a visit of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet to China. We find it highly regrettable that the Chinese authorities did not provide full and unfettered access to High Commissioner Bachelet. While the High Commissioner expressed that the visit was not of an investigative nature, she also clarified that she has been unable to assess the full scale of political re-education camps in Xinjiang. The EU also deplores that her engagement with independent civil society organisations and human rights defenders was limited and somehow supervised. The visit has been further discussed today in Geneva as part of the Strategic Dialogue on Human Rights between the EU and the Office of the High Commissioner, co-chaired by Eamon Gilmore, the EU Special Representative for Human Rights, and High Commissioner Bachelet. This visit and the release of the Xinjiang police files call for the release, as a matter of absolute priority, of the remote monitoring report on the human rights situation in Xinjiang prepared by the United Nations through the Office. Let me assure you that the EU will continue to speak out against human rights violations occurring across China. We will also continue to convey our concerns to the Chinese leadership. In doing so, we will always make it clear that the EU will not compromise on human rights."}

The extraordinary meeting has one sole purpose: to develop the Council’s mandate for the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework. As part of the preparations, two inter-related negotiating boxes have been produced. To put it bluntly, we are not satisfied, and we cannot possibly be satisfied with what has been presented. We are also annoyed, to put it mildly, by the Council’s conduct on budgetary issues, which can be described in one word: irresponsible! We can only repeat what we said in June last year, namely that we need a proper system of own resources which is worthy of the name. The Commission has taken a first small step, but this is not enough. There is almost nothing we need more urgently than these genuine own resources, for they would mean that the European budget would no longer be dependent on national contributions. We need this independence to put an end to this untenable situation. There would also be no further logic to the arguments being advanced in some Member States. As Mr Reul has just said, the debate there is only ever about payments, contributions and spending. They never discuss political priorities, their priorities. They never tell us what they would like to achieve with the European budget. No ideas are forthcoming about the future of the European Union. The Council is not acting like a European institution. Instead, it has become a collection of 27 sets of national self-interest, where they all bicker like children The budget is like a pie, and yes, there should be pie, but they squabble over which ingredients they should provide and how big their slice of the pie should be. Everyone wants to eat and no one wants to bake. It is appalling!"}

We shall vote for them not because they are totally satisfactory – as my colleagues said, we would have liked to have tabled a number of amendments – but because swift action is required. Mrs Krehl made this point just now. Forgive me for wondering though, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, whether we simply do not have a clue. We are here in comfortably heated and well lit surroundings. Do you know that, right now in Europe, there are 30 million homes with leaking roofs and damp in the walls? Of course, with the 4% from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) we are going to be able to remedy this situation for around 1 million homes. This work, if we oversee it, Commissioner – as I am going to put a request to you in a moment – will create 250 000 jobs and improve the situation in 1 million homes. This will save 40 million tonnes of CO2 and reduce the energy bill of each family by EUR 450 per year. Those are the figures that I place at your disposal and that have been finalised by an important European organisation known in particular for its serious approach. This therefore means that the importance of the decision that we are going to take not only to guarantee a recovery but also for the well-being of our fellow citizens, comes down to one major condition: that the decisions taken by Parliament today, in concert with the Commission, take practical effect in the coming weeks and months. Commissioner, we listened to you carefully just now. You told us – and we believe you – that, by 30 June 2010, you will have asked each Member State to submit a report to the Commission. I and my colleagues, of all political persuasions, from the Committee on Regional Development are game for a bet. In all the countries, the operational programmes have just been adopted, and we know that the majority of the management authorities in these countries will not want them to be changed. In 15 months’ time, on 30 June, Commissioner, do not employ too many staff to draft the reports, the analysis of what will be done, as you will not achieve a great deal if you wait for the Member States, the management authorities and partners to set to work. We therefore have EUR 8 billion available on the one hand, and 30 million particularly deficient houses on the other. What needs to be done? Commissioner, I along with my colleagues am going to make a proposal to you along these lines. The European Commission should go beyond its rights and act firmly – I was almost going to say violently – towards the governments and the management authorities to instruct them to apply these provisions as quickly as possible. MEPs love voting for texts. That is our job. However, we especially love it when these texts are applied. We need the Commission, we hope that the Commission will listen to us."}
{"id": "a77678fc-4bef-494b-9e4c-687fd139dcf9", "text": "Madam President, I am afraid we may have the same passion in this discussion on democracy in Turkey as we had on the wine reform during the second half of Arsenal v Manchester United, which is a snapshot of Europe in 2009. This is more serious, because this is a very serious matter and indeed a very substantive issue concerning democratic development in Turkey. First of all I am deeply saddened and shocked by the massacre that took place in Bilge in Turkey last night, killing 44 people. I offer my sincere condolences to the families and friends of the victims and I trust that the murderers will be brought to justice as soon as possible. There is no moral or ethical justification of this kind of horrible attack. Let me also express my personal, and the Commission’s, sorrow on the death of nine Turkish soldiers and a gendarme as a consequence of the terrorist attacks last week. Our thoughts are with the families of those who lost their lives. We condemn terrorism and support Turkey in its fight against terrorism. The PKK is on the EU list of terrorist organisations. Between 14 and 18 April more than 200 officials and members of the Democratic Society Party have been arrested in a police operation throughout Turkey, and in particular in its south-eastern region. We understand that charges brought against them include being a member of a terrorist organisation, although a formal indictment is still pending. We expect to see the indictment finalised as part of a transparent and objective judicial process. The Commission cannot interfere in ongoing legal cases. However, our approach is clear: while we support the fight against terrorism, we have consistently stressed that it must be conducted by respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular as regards the freedom of expression and association. Political pluralism is an integral part of any democracy. The Turkish Grand National Assembly is today largely representative of the country’s political diversity. The Democratic Society Party has been contributing to pluralism in Turkey, and its political legitimacy was confirmed by the results of the recent local elections in March. At the same time, the people of south-east Turkey need peace, they need stability and prosperity rather than further violence or confrontation. Condemning the use of force and violence is a duty for all parties involved. All must exercise restraint and be committed to peaceful means and peaceful means only. This is also an integral part of any democracy. We will continue to follow up closely the developments of this case. It is essential that the principles of democracy and the rule of law, including the rights of defendants, will prevail. The Commission also continues to follow closely the closure case against the DTP currently pending in the Constitutional Court. In this context, the current rules governing the closure of political parties in Turkey are not in line with the European Convention of Human Rights and with European practices, as was recently stated in an opinion of the Venice Commission. We have requested Turkey to take such an opinion fully into account and to reflect it in the Turkish constitutional and legislative framework in the form of revisions to this effect. To conclude, we continue to encourage the Turkish authorities to address the problems of the south-east of the country and its people, in order to enhance the economic, social and cultural opportunities of all Turkish citizens irrespective of their ethnic, religious or linguistic origins. Under the Copenhagen political criteria, Turkey is expected to ensure cultural diversity and promote cultural rights of all its citizens, as set out in our Accession Partnership. In this context, the establishment of a new TRT channel broadcasting in the Kurdish language is a step forward. It shows a change of mentality and I want to encourage the Turkish authorities to take further steps in this direction. We will continue to monitor the situation in the south-east and will report in our upcoming progress report. That is an essential part of the process of democratisation of Turkey."}

I also praise the Polish Presidency and the Commission for their efforts to reach an agreement on first reading. Parliament, the Council and the Commission have had divergent positions, sometimes very different, on several issues, and this made the agreement far from easy and not fully satisfactory to everyone, but we can say that it is reasonably satisfactory. The point that must be highlighted in the amendment of this directive, as already stated, is that, from now on, sugar may not be added to either pressed or concentrated juices. However, fruit nectars will be products sweetened with sugar, honey or sweeteners. It is clear that the average consumer is unaware of this legislation and, therefore, of the difference between juices and nectars. For this reason, I feel that the agreement between the three institutions to put a statement on packaging for a limited period to say that fruit juices do not contain sugar will not only help consumers to tell the difference between two products, but also make them much better informed. The objective of this initiative was to amend Directive 2001/112/EC for the second time, bringing it into line with technical progress and the developments in international regulations relating to the Codex Alimentarius. However, despite the support of all the farming organisations in the Union, as already mentioned, the Council and the Commission, surprisingly, have rejected the possibility of mandarin juice being added to orange juice in amounts less than 10% and mandarin appearing on the list of ingredients, as permitted by the Codex Alimentarius (STAN 45-1981), given that this is common practice in Brazil and the United States, from which we import a large amount of concentrates. In this regard, another area of conflict during the negotiations was the restoration of flavour, pulp and cells lost during the juice and nectar extraction process. All sides agreed, during the negotiations, to maintain the Commission’s original proposal on restoring flavours, pulp and cells from the same fruit species. However, some members of my political group are going to vote against this report for precisely this reason. Lastly, I would like to mention two things that worry me. Firstly, imported products marketed within the European Union are not generally required to meet the same quality and food safety standards as our own products, and in a case such as this one, in which such standards are required by the legislation, they are not sufficiently controlled. The second thing, which also concerns me, is the way the Commission uses delegated acts to substantially amend legislation, as it has recently attempted to do with the regulation on nutrition and health claims with regard to the ‘no added sugar’ claim. This is similar to what it is trying to do at the moment, although it is not the same case, with the Timber Regulation. This is the reason for Parliament’s position on delegated acts."}

The European Union wants to continue deepening its strategic partnership with India. India is now the most populated country in the world and has significant economic potential. India’s geopolitical positioning and domestic policy choices, particularly on climate and environmental issues, have implications for the Indo-Pacific region, and indeed for the rest of the world. It is in the context of India’s steady rise and regional and global power dynamics that we should assess the strategic partnership between the EU and India. Broadly speaking, EU relations with India are expanding and enjoying positive momentum. As the rapporteur points out, our strategic partnership with India is guided by a bilateral political framework – the Roadmap to 2025 – which guides joint action in many policy areas to further strengthen our relationship. The implementation of the Roadmap is continuously monitored and well advanced. The EU and India have a common interest in each other’s security, prosperity and sustainable development, and together can contribute to a safer, cleaner and more stable world. Last year, we witnessed the magnitude and success of India’s G20 presidency, and we recognise India’s efforts to put the priorities and concerns of developing countries high on the agenda. Let me continue by highlighting some recent achievements of our deepening partnership. The relaunch of negotiations for an EU free trade agreement with India was a momentous development, back in 2022. There have now been six rounds of talks, with both sides prioritising a comprehensive and ambitious trade agreement as the outcome. The EU and India also established a ministerial-level Trade and Technology Council, TTC, in May 2023, in order to give high-level political steering to our cooperation in strategic issues at the nexus of trade, trusted technology and security. We expect to hold the next meeting soon. In 2021, the EU and India adopted a connectivity partnership and together with the EU’s Global Gateway Strategy and the European Investment Bank, we are making progress in key sectors such as energy, urbanisation, digitalisation and transport. In addition, the EU is strengthening its cooperation with India on security and defence with regular thematic dialogues, joint naval exercises and closer cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. Honourable Members, while our relations with India are experiencing an overall positive trajectory, we are conscious of the reports about the deteriorating human rights situation and shrinking civil society space, which are addressed at length in your report. I would like to reassure you that human rights are indispensable elements in EU foreign policy towards all our partners, India being no exception. In this context, let me highlight that the EU is the only external partner with whom India has a dedicated human rights dialogue. We attach great importance to this dialogue and the ability to have genuine discussions with India as strategic partners, even on sensitive issues like this one. In conclusion, with the world facing major geopolitical challenges, India remains a crucial strategic partner for the EU. Our ability to strategically navigate the 21st century and work together on key priorities will bring great benefits to both Europe and India, and to the rest of the world."}

Brazil is one of the EU’s strategic partners, traditionally a strong advocate for human rights and a partner in multilateral fora. During the recent dedicated EU—Brazil dialogue on human rights held on 16 June, the EU’s Special Representative for Human Rights, Eamon Gilmore, stressed the deteriorating situation for human rights defenders in many parts of Brazil. He specifically addressed the brutal murder of Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira and emphasised the need for a full investigation. These specific, tragic cases highlight the need for a more comprehensive effort in Brazil to address the challenge of violence against indigenous and environmental defenders, including full and transparent investigations to bring those responsible to justice. Over the past few months, these concerns have been voiced in a series of high—level visits to Brazil, including by EU High Representative Borrell in November, by the EU’s Special Representative for Human Rights Gilmore in December, and by myself in April, when I visited Brazil to discuss in particular our legislative proposal on deforestation, which aims to protect the rich biodiversity of our forests, which as many of you tonight mentioned, are the lungs of our planet. And protection of our forests was also what Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira were fighting for. Our outreach encompassed meetings with the federal and state authorities, including the legislative and judiciary bodies, as well as with indigenous peoples’ organisations and human rights and environmental defenders. Diplomatic outreach is also carried out by the EU delegation in Brazil in a Team—Europe approach at all levels – federal and sub—federal, with state and non-state actors. Continuous engagement with civil society, including human rights, indigenous and environmental defenders and organisations, is another important component of our ongoing work to show our support and to raise awareness. We also provide financial and technical support through our cooperation activities. Current EU cooperation to support indigenous peoples under the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights and civil society organisations and local authorities totals more than EUR 3 million. Our actions focus on the urgent protection of the rights of indigenous peoples and forest defenders, with a special focus on women, as well as on supporting indigenous groups, advocating for their rights at national and international levels, and promoting sustainable development. In addition to the dialogue with human rights defenders across Brazil, the EU delegation also supports the National Human Rights Council to protect human rights defenders and freedom of expression. I want to reassure this House and their families, to whom I reiterate my personal and sincere condolences, that the EU will continue to monitor closely the case around the brutal murder of Dom Phillips and Bruno Pereira. We recognise the European Parliament’s strong commitment on this important matter and reiterate the EU’s determination to work with Brazil in supporting the rights of indigenous people and human rights defenders, notably in the Amazon."}

What the US real estate operators did is common knowledge: they offered loans, which were then defaulted on, to high-risk individuals, thus placing not only the financial products but also many banks in crisis. This year a very high percentage of borrowers has stopped paying the instalments owed, placing the entire system in crisis. In Italy, apart from the stock-market movements, it appears that the crisis has only had a slight effect on the national banking system because Italian banks, apparently, are not directly exposed to sub-prime loans. This was not the case for many German, British and French banks and that is why we are having this debate today. Therefore the least we can hope for is the opening of an enquiry into the largest international credit rating agencies on their role in these events and thus action on financial instability and on the impact on the real economy. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to tell you what happens in Italy – because loans and home purchases in my country are significant – and let me recount to you what an important Italian weekly publication, L'Espresso, said about the ethics of some Italian politicians (who, by the way, have also been our colleagues) in the face of the sufferings of so many savers and those who clamber to pay loans, when in fact a simple institution such as the social loan could make owning a house a reality. In the face of all this, listen to what L'Espresso reveals about some Italian left-wing politicians – a fact that is worth emphasising – as well as some centrist figures, but above all left-wing ones. These gentlemen, whose first and last names and addresses are listed, benefited from exceptionally favourable terms for purchasing property in Rome. Recommendations, you may say, are a practice, perhaps an accepted practice, and perhaps an ancient practice, in my country – and not just in Italy, but perhaps worldwide. However, when a recommendation is requested and the favour is obtained from a bank or insurance company, I ask myself, what is given in exchange by those in power? According to the weekly publication, Mr Veltroni, Mr Prodi’s successor, Ms Cossutta, daughter of one of the most radical and committed communists, Mr Violante, former Prime Minister and among the most well-known arbiters of other people’s ethics, as well as Mr Marino, Mr Mancino, Mr Mastella, Mr Casini, Mr Proietti and Mr Baccini purchased houses in Rome with at times as many as 25-30 rooms at a quarter, if not less, of the market price, given these special terms by owners who, strangely enough, are banks and insurance companies. Democracy has its costs, you may say, and as the proletariat had its costs so today does progressive socialism, which has inherited from its predecessors the ability to be specific in the pursuit of its own interests. If you are strangled by your mortgage month after month and, like me, you have the good fortune to suffer from it a little less thanks to this seat in Parliament and the activity of your spouse who now contributes, you should blame the communists, old and new, who have decided to liberalise taxi licences and the opening hours of barbers and to sell medicine in supermarkets, but have left the banks free to decide what sacrifices to impose on your families, to mortgage your futures and your lives. You have only yourselves to blame, Italian and European citizens, if you have decided to do something other than pursue a career in one of the Italian parties that govern or have governed cities, regions and nations, and which in governing are governed by the banks."}

At the last summit we had, EU-CELAC, the UN, partner countries in Latin America and the Caribbean agreed on the need to support Haiti in tackling the dire humanitarian crisis and in paving the way towards security and stabilisation. For countries like Haiti, the proliferation of illicit small arms and light weapons is at the origin of the strength of the gangs and is detrimental to the achievement of sustainable peace, security and socio-economic development, including in the rest of the region. Therefore, the summit declaration included specific provisions on the fight against illicit arms trafficking, which is instrumental to curb domestic and transnational organised crime, drug trafficking, trafficking in persons, money laundering, the illegal exploitation of natural resources, and domestic violence. In the same declaration, we also stressed the need to consolidate and strengthen the EU-CELAC cooperation initiatives in the field of citizen security and social justice, such as EU-LAC Partnership on Justice and Security. On these themes, the EU is ready to do its part. Regarding the participation directly to the multinational security intervention (MSSM) in Haiti, I should remind you that the EU’s support could consist in actions that support the mission and indirectly, notably with complementary actions that could provide an enabling environment for the work of the mission or help the sustainability of its results. Prospects for a direct EU contribution in terms of equipment and personnel would depend directly on the readiness of the EU Member States to contribute, and in any case, we should stress that the EU is already providing significant and indirect support to the Kenyan Defence Forces through the European Peace Facility to increase their capability in order to participate in peacekeeping operations, and we hope this is the case now. So thank you very much for the debate, President, that is all."}

The past year has been one of the decisive actions by the Union in the field of energy policy. The ongoing war of aggression in Ukraine and the overall geopolitical instability has only underlined how important it is for the Union and its Member States to reduce to a minimum our toxic dependencies on unreliable partners and to increase our strategic autonomy. Energy lies at the heart of our economies. It makes our industries function, it heats our homes, it fuels our transport, it keeps our food, it switches on our computers. The more we control that essential input to our way of life, the less vulnerable we will be to external shocks. Our Green Deal and REPowerEU objectives to have that energy mostly coming from clean indigenous sources therefore makes total sense. We should congratulate ourselves for all the actions taken to tackle the consequences of the war in Ukraine. We should be proud of having reduced our dependence on Russian fossil fuels, to tighten the rules of gas storage, to have increased the renewable generation in record quantities. We have been and are fully committed to bringing the EU legislative framework up to date to be able to face these challenging times with all the tools Member States need to ensure we reach net zero objectives. We have delivered on RED, on energy efficiency, we delivered on gas storage and we will deliver on methane, on energy performance of buildings, on the gas and hydrogen package, on REMIT, electricity market design and the Net Zero Industry Act. Commissioner Simson spoke about needing to step up our efforts to achieve our goals. As Chair of the ITRE Committee and a Member of the EPP Group, I expect the Commission to take full advantage of this end of the term and all the analysis presented today, to carry out all the necessary impact assessments that will allow the next Commission and co-legislators to take action when needed. Thank you so much and congratulations."}

Now, ever since the Commission has adopted this proposal in June 2022, it has been the subject of strong and passionate debate, both among the honourable Members in this House and also in the wider stakeholder community. And this is entirely understandable, because the use of pesticides is both an important and a sensitive topic. Our previous discussions made clear that we can at least agree on one basic principle, namely, the importance of protecting citizens’ health and the environment, at the same time protecting the EU’s farmers, agricultural production and food security. And because we agree on this principle, I believe it is possible to reconcile the differing views and to make constructive progress on this file. Constructive progress that will, on the one hand, respond to the demands from the citizens and consumers to reduce the use and risk of pesticides but, on the other hand, simultaneously ensure that our farmers retain an effective pest control toolbox and sufficient alternatives to the use of chemical pesticides. I note the emphasis placed on setting a positive target for the use of bio-control and low-risk products. The Commission - and I wanted to share this with you - is working intensively with Member States, industry and stakeholders to promote the availability and use of bio-control and low-risk alternatives to chemical pesticides. Our non-paper on sensitive areas highlighted numerous ways in which the use and risk of pesticides could be reduced in such areas and still protect our agriculture. We also provided a comprehensive complementary analysis after the proposal had been adopted at the Council’s request. In our response, we emphasise how progress towards the pesticide reduction targets could be made without compromising our food security and how the administrative burden on small- and medium-scale farmers can be reduced and minimised. Turning to the international aspects, we must not lose sight of the goals agreed at the COP 15 global biodiversity framework meeting in Montreal last December. One such international agreed target focuses on the overall risk from pesticides by at least half by 2030, including through integrated pest management and taking into account food security and livelihoods. This target comes close with the ambitions set out in the Commission’s SUR proposal. President, honourable Members, I have always believed that it is of utmost importance that all views on this topic are listened to both carefully and respectfully. The Commission has been doing that for the last 18 months. We have been showing pragmatism and flexibility, and I maintain that belief because I think it is our best chance at achieving progress. I’m going to be hearing all the points raised in this debate very carefully. I hope that they can be brought forward in the trilogue discussions that will follow, once Council agrees on its general approach on this file. Once again, thank you for all your constructive discussions with this, I look forward to the debate."}

More than a million indigenous lives are currently in danger. Deforestation fires have burned the Amazon for decades; fires have increased by 85% under the current Bolsonaro Government. The Amazon is not the only region being destroyed. There are no ordinary fires; the destruction of the Amazon will rapidly accelerate global warming, increase the overall temperature of the planet, and destroy biodiversity and indigenous life within the forest. What are we doing while the Amazon forest burns to the ground? Are we just going to sit and watch in horror while our planet burns? No. We need to act, and the need to act was yesterday. I want to ask the Commission: what is the strategy here? What is EU doing to protect and tackle forest fires worldwide? What actions and financial support can be offered to stop and control these fires?"}

The proposed regulation on plant reproductive material was intended to set rules to ensure the identity and quality of marketed plant products. However, home gardeners and small breeders have rightly raised a number of issues, pointing out that the proposal does not take account of the differing needs of home gardeners and large-scale farmers and would lead to less choice for gardeners. In addition, the proposal lacks clarity in many areas, while the rules could potentially prevent new plant varieties being introduced onto the market and represent a financial burden for smaller breeders, both of which could lead to a reduction in the variety of species available. Labour MEPs were sympathetic to these objections and voted to reject this report on the basis that a ‘one-size-fits-allʼ approach is not appropriate and the proposed law would not provide the necessary protection for agri-biodiversity. The late publication of the report has also not left adequate time for proper scrutiny in this mandate and we are calling for the Commission to come forward with a re-drafted proposal in the next mandate."}

As we stand on the brink of voting on a groundbreaking legislative package, I am humbled and proud to have been part of the negotiations that have led us to this pivotal moment. I want to thank dear co-rapporteurs Luděk Niedermayer, Eva Poptcheva, Emil Radev, Eero Heinäluoma and Damien Carême. The scandals that tarnished our financial systems in recent years – think of Danske Bank to the Cyprus Confidential files – served as stark reminders for the negotiators to act decisively and move forward. And yet we had to witness another scandal of incredible scale when Putin invaded Ukraine and Russian oligarchs massively flew and drove their private jets, sports cars and super yachts outside the EU. This added up to the already existing urgent need – often voiced by the European Parliament – to address the fragmented and poorly coordinated national rules that have allowed nefarious actors to exploit regulatory gaps and evade detection. It is a pivotal moment for two reasons. First, the package is more European, more coordinated than ever before and this is needed since national borders do not deter, but even help criminals and terrorists. The new authority is a strong symbol for European coordination, but also the first AML regulation underlines this approach. Second, the package is more targeted than before. Parliament’s efforts have paid off: the registration of high-value assets like cars, boats and planes; the single access point for real estate and land; the vigilance for high net-worth, high-risk individuals and so on. As proud as we are of this result, we must recognise, as Luděk Niedermayer emphasised already, that the fight against money laundering is ongoing and ever evolving. There is still work to do. First, on access to the BO register: the directive lays down the principles for access requiring easy access for those with a legitimate interest and introducing mutual recognition. Yet the current situation is chaotic at best and hampers access for journalists, researchers and NGOs. Their access needs to be restored as soon as possible and I call on the Member States to restore access as soon as. Get it done, now! Don’t wait for the legislation! Second, in Parliament I have worked intensively on fighting both tax evasion and money laundering. I have always found it very confusing that despite all the similarities – similar constructions, similar actors – there are two different silos of institutions and legislations. This is confusing but also ineffective. So I call on the Commission to eradicate the barriers between the two silos and have a more integrated approach. The Commission can start with ensuring the exchange of data and information among the institutions, like FIUs and tax administrations. In the modern economy, data and information are becoming more and more important and this holds especially for the fight against tax evasion and money laundering. Please Commission, get started. As we prepare to cast our votes, let us do so with the knowledge that we are enacting meaningful change this week, not just for ourselves, but for future generations of Europeans. Let us stand firm in our resolve to uphold the values of transparency, integrity and justice that lie at these proposals but also at the heart of the European Union."}

I shall endeavour to give you briefly the broad EU view from the Council’s perspective, and afterwards the Commission will be in a position to elaborate on the topics concerned. I would first of all like to stress that advancing on business and human rights is an important priority of the EU’s human rights agenda, as set out in the EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy for the period 2015—2019, adopted by the Council on 20 July 2015. It should be noted that the recurrent element which is underpinning all our actions identified in the action plan is the United Nations Guiding Principles of 2011 as the first, and so far only authoritative global framework to address the impact of business on human rights. In its 2016 conclusions on business and human rights, the Council recalled the global consensus reached on the UN Guiding Principles adopted in 2011 and stressed that any possible further steps regarding the international legal framework for business and human rights at UN level must be inclusive, firmly rooted in the UN Guiding Principles, and address all types of companies, not only transnational. These three principles have always constituted our barometers for engagement in the intergovernmental working group process. President, honourable Members, I can reassure you that the Council, in particular through its Working Party on Human Rights, continues working on the business and human rights file, including on developing our common position on the process regarding a possible legally binding instrument. The EU is, at the same time, progressing on other tracks, notably the Working Group on Business and Human Rights and the Annual Forum on Business and Human Rights, specifically on efforts to achieve a coherent approach throughout the EU on access to remedy for victims of business-related human rights violations. The EU continues to offer its support to the accountability and remedy project led by the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights, recognising that the initiative may provide best practices that can be implemented at EU and Member State level, including on improved cooperation between states in cross-border cases. I’m looking forward to the debate and to hearing the Commission’s input."}
{"id": "29786d0b-58c4-4079-aa74-03b81b32eb79", "text": "Mr President, the rapporteur accepts that government finances in several euro zone countries are still not in good shape. Sovereign debts in Italy and Greece have not fallen significantly, and although deficits have been falling, this is a result of some higher economic growth helped by global recovery. It is not evidence that the Stability Pact is working. However, this week’s news from Spain has shown that weak government finances are not the only threat to the functioning of the euro. Spain has an awful trade deficit of 9.5% of GDP, and its construction asset price boom, which has driven domestic demand, is now definitely over. The boom was driven by euro interest rates which had been far too low but are now too high. Spain can now look forward to serious economic difficulties, with rising unemployment and deteriorating government finances. The normal solution to this dilemma would be for Spain to lower its interest rates and devalue, but neither of these options is available as it shares the single currency. There are therefore three possible outcomes. The first: to forestall a crisis, the European Central Bank reduces the euro interest rate. Germany would not like this, as it would lead to rising inflation; it would also mean the European Central Bank losing its hard-won reputation for holding down inflation expectations. The second possible outcome is that Spain leaves the euro zone and re-establishes its own currency, enabling it to devalue and have suitably low interest rates. Yes, we have come to the point when this may no longer be unthinkable. It would lead to serious problems of private and public sector debt default that would spill over across the whole euro zone. Other countries would not want this, which makes the third possible outcome maybe the most likely, and that is large-scale bailout by other countries, despite Maastricht rules against this, and this would be accompanied by centralisation of control over Spanish public finances. I do not know which of these outcomes will take place, but it is time we faced up to the circumstances: Spain is a large country and the European Union would not find it easy to stand idle while it suffers in recession."}
{"id": "a349cfb7-0798-4942-8c1b-5aaf80750ca6", "text": "Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Members for this fruitful debate. Parliament has an important role to play in the debating of European economic policies and the future of EMU, so I have carefully taken note of Members’ remarks and the points raised today. While different views and opinions were expressed during the debate, I note that there is also certain support for a new Commission approach to the revamped European Semester, and there are certain elements which still need to be fine—tuned to find the right way forward. On some of the issues which have been raised during this debate: firstly, environmental measures or environmental policy-related measures in the European Semester bring us to the next debate on the Europe 2020 Strategy. But I would emphasise that we are streamlining the European Semester, we are trying to focus on key social economic challenges in the Member States and we are applying the ʻtell only onceʼ principle, so we are not doubling some of the advice that we are giving to the Member States in the context of other EU policies. The low CSR implementation is a cause of concern. It is something we need to address, but we believe the best way to address this is through improved membership in the Member States so that Member States, stakeholders, national parliaments, governments and social partners are better involved in decision-making and are better informed about the economic challenges both at the euro area level and the EU level, and how it goes in a national context. Then on some of the questions of surplus versus deficit countries which were raised here, I must note that excessive current account surpluses are indeed also considered as a macroeconomic imbalance by the European Commission, as outlined in our macroeconomic imbalance procedures. That is why countries like Germany, for example, are also in macroeconomic imbalance due to a large and sustained current account surplus. We recommend strengthening investment and strengthening and stimulating the demand side of the economy. Indeed the demand side of the economy is part of our economic strategy, so what we need to focus on is how to strengthen the economic recovery in Europe, and of course the demand side is one of the answers. Some questions were raised on the ambition of this current Commission proposal and reference was made to some specific instruments, for example fiscal capacity. It must be noted that some of those elements were, for example, in the Five Presidents’ Report where there is a reference to euro area stabilisation. This extends a similar concept since this used to be referred to in some earlier documents as fiscal capacity, and this is foreseen for Stage 2 of the Five Presidents’ Report. I have been outlining also the Commissionʼs preparation of that Stage 2 of the Five Presidents’ Report so this is going to be part of that work. Indeed the Commission is open to looking at ways of how to ensure stronger involvement of the European Parliament in the European Semester and macroeconomic policy decision-making, and indeed I sense also from today’s debate that there is some further work and consideration needed."}

Indeed, this is an important milestone in the creation of a common European policy in areas as sensitive as foreign affairs, security and defence. Every day, from Georgia to the coasts of Somalia, from the Balkans to Gaza, we can clearly see how much this common policy is needed and also – I was going to say above all – how much our citizens want it. Because, above and beyond the interinstitutional powers which we are welcoming today in this compromise and, in particular, the increased role given to Parliament, we must clearly emphasise the strategic opportunity represented by this External Action Service, which is an essential tool for equipping the EU with a more ambitious, more consistent, more credible and more effective common foreign and security policy. Baroness Ashton, may I say to you, as Chair of Parliament’s Subcommittee on Security and Defence and also, to some extent, as a Frenchman, that I insist on the particular responsibility which you will have to exercise, that of crisis management, by preserving and strengthening the EU’s unique character and added value, in other words, its civil-military capabilities – the two words go together. You are the one who will be responsible for ensuring that the EU maintains and increases its capabilities by rejecting the ill-founded suspicions that are voiced here and there – and indeed sometimes in this Chamber – to the effect that the service will be militarised, and by joining with Parliament as much as possible in clearly affirming the legitimacy of any operations conducted by the EU in crisis locations."}

Now, our draft presented to you focuses mainly on the situation in the European institutions or in the European Parliament, but it is important to bear in mind the wider context and culture where harassment is still prevalent in many of our societies. And the problem, of course, is quite clear if you look at the figures and, although sexual harassment and harassment as such affects all Europeans, 90% of victims are women. And 55% of women in the EU have been sexually harassed at least once since the age of 15. And much has been spoken about and written about this issue especially, and thanks to the MeToo movement more than six years ago. But words, colleagues are not enough and we must do more to eliminate any and all forms of harassment. And we owe it to the victims, not just here in Parliament, but across the continent. And we owe it to the next generation of Europeans. Now, I would, at this point, like to thank so much all the shadow rapporteurs, all the policy advisers, the assistants and the external experts, because this is a joint product and it is a product of a very constructive work both before and during the vote in committee. The draft report addresses all the core issues and indeed has carried a broad majority in the committee with no one voting against it. And I am especially glad that most of the groups and all the democratic groups have cooperated on this report and that we’ve been able to find a consensus that can bring us closer to an EU free of sexual harassment. I should also add that this is not the first resolution of this kind in this mandate. And it is true that many of the commitments from previous resolutions, commitments we have made to the victims here in the European Parliament, and indeed to all Europeans, to combat all forms of gender-based violence, that many of the commitments are yet to be fulfilled. And with this report we hope to close that gap. We propose several clear and easy or quick to implement solutions first and foremost. We as Parliament should put in place zero-tolerance policies that reflect the pain suffered by those who are subject to harassment or abuse. And the draft contains also many other measures, recommendations on anti harassment measures to the European Parliament, to the institutions, but also to Member States governments. I personally think that the crucial aspect and the crucial thing, at least here in Parliament, but more broadly, is to break the silence of the victims who need our complete protection and support. Because, as we all know, cases here in the European Parliament are still under-reported, which means that existing both formal and informal channels of reporting need to be strengthened because – and this is also why it is important that we focus on the European Parliament – the EU institutions must lead by example here. I understand and I know that it is not always easy to implement systemic change. It is seems difficult at the beginning, but I’m glad to see that many bodies and colleagues here in the European Parliament are working on this, the advisory committees, the Quaestors, the High Level Group on Equality, the EP’s own Bureau, but also the working committee in AFCO are engaged in this work and are carrying it forward. And I really do hope that by endorsing this report with a strong majority, we can help end discrimination and gender-based violence here in Parliament and in Europe. Thank you so much."}

I think that indeed ‘Europeana – the next steps’ is just a start of a very challenging adventure and it shows, by the way, the strong political support for the further development of Europeana as a common access point to Europe’s rich and diverse cultural heritage in the digital age. So I would like to thank Mrs Trüpel, the rapporteur, for the work she has done and also give her my compliments for the branding, since the branding itself is already unique: ‘Europeana’ – you do not need to explain what it is all about. The Commission can also support the alternative motion for a resolution, which has the agreement of the main political groups in Parliament, I have been informed. It is an ambitious project and again, I repeat, it is the start. It aims to make digitised books, newspapers, maps, museum objects, audiovisual material and sound archives from across Europe available on the Internet. That is essential to ensure access to culture in the digital age. It is not only what Mr Migalski said: something that makes us better citizens. Well, let us wait and find out, but, anyhow, it gives an opportunity to be more happy, for enjoying culture is, in most cases, enjoying happiness, so to speak. It is Parliament’s report that rightly underlines that there is also an economic component. The digitisation and the online accessibility of our cultural heritage will benefit different sectors of activity: think of education, research, tourism and the media. The Europeana site is the result of an unprecedented collaboration between European libraries, archives and museums. At present, as was rightly mentioned by Mrs Trüpel, it gives direct access to 7 million digitised objects. Again, this is just a start and let us go for it. More can be done and more needs to be done. The Parliament report highlights different areas for Europeana and for the related policies where progress must be made in the coming years. The development of the site depends, in the first place, on the input from Member States who should do more to digitise their cultural heritage and to make all digitised objects available through Europeana. I am glad that Parliament joins the Commission in asking Member States to make fast progress in doing so. The sooner the better. Parliament underlines that Europeana should not just give access to public domain works, but should also include material that is still in copyright. Indeed, there is an urgent need – and that is my answer to Mrs Ţicău – to find workable solutions for bringing out-of-print works online, for dealing with the issue of orphan works (works for which it is impossible to locate the rights holders). Failing to do so bears the risk that Europe will lag behind within a few years from now, in particular, compared to the US. At present, the Commission is carrying out an impact assessment on a possible legal solution for orphan works at European level and we are discussing what could be done, but if you do not mind, I will come back to that when we talk of the digital agenda, for that is one of the issues that we have to touch upon. An enhanced version of Europeana will be launched later this year, and is expected to give, by then, access to more than 10 million digitised objects. The site will be further developed in the years thereafter. Parliament rightly points out that for the success of Europeana, it is a must to increase the awareness of the site both among cultural institutions, who could contribute their digitised content, and among the general public. Special attention should be given to younger people, rightly mentioned by you, an extremely important part of our population, who could be targeted through the schools. The Commission is fully committed to continuing work on the development of Europeana and the policies related to it and that will be a key area of work in the European Digital Agenda. It is anyhow worthwhile to fight for it."}

Through Global Gateway and its Team Europe initiatives we aim to address the world’s most pressing challenges: the infrastructure gap; the digital divide; climate change; pandemic recovery; increasing inequalities; and preparation for future health crises. It is our principal means to help our partner countries achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. It is just over a year since Global Gateway was announced. We have used that time to set a solid foundation for the strategy, identifying key actions and establishing governance structures. Now we must use 2023 to deliver progress on the ground. First, we have identified a wide range of global gateway flagship programmes across the world, to deliver real transformation in digital and green transitions, transport, health, education and other key sectors. We will push ahead with all of these in partnership with Member States and the European financing institutions’ Team Europe, focusing and combining our efforts for greater impact. Geopolitically, we have used Global Gateway to boost the EU’s profile with key regions of the world. We have seen the announcement of the EU investment packages at the summits with the African Union in February 2022 and with ASEAN in December. We have had important meetings with partners from the Indo—Pacific, and on connectivity in Central Asia. We will develop another important investment agenda for the EU—CELAC summit in July this year. Second, through the European Fund for Sustainable Development Plus, we are mobilising additional funding, including private investors and businesses, acknowledging the private sector’s crucial role in the Global Gateway rollout. We have also made good progress with the governance of the Global Gateway strategy. The first meeting of the Global Gateway Board successfully took place on 11 December under the chairmanship of President von der Leyen. We were pleased that Members of the European Parliament were able to participate as observers, and we are grateful for their very useful contributions. There will be a dedicated business advisory group to allow exchanges with relevant European businesses. In parallel, we will continue to hold dialogues with civil society organisations. This will allow the Board to give strong but realistic strategic guidance on our collective ambitions. Finally, I am pleased that the Global Gateway and Team Europe initiatives are already starting to improve the EU’s and Member States collective visibility, and also their impact. Many EU delegations report increased cooperation with Member States’ embassies on the ground. So what’s next? For this year, it is clear that our focus has to be on implementation of the initiatives and flagships already identified. We and our partners want major transformational impact, and we want it quickly. Team Europe’s focus will be on rapid delivery, and we look for Parliament’s support in this. Coupled with this will be a strong strategic communication effort to demonstrate the real value of Global Gateway to partner countries, businesses, multilateral partners and, of course, to the public of Europe and across the world. Again, the European Parliament has an important role in conveying this positive message. Thank you very much for your interest in this important issue, I’m looking forward to listening to your comments."}

That caused considerable financial losses and, above all, as previous speakers have pointed out, more than 10 million people, not all of whom were on tourist trips, had to postpone their journeys and find other means of transport. This was a result of the havoc wrought by a wholly natural event, which placed us in an important context in relation to nature, and which caused unprecedented paralysis in the skies above Europe. It is, of course, difficult to predict a volcanic eruption and, even more so, the formation of a volcanic ash cloud – more difficult, of course, than predicting a snow episode. However, the crisis caused by this cloud highlights all the shortcomings and deficiencies of air traffic management in the Union as well as the weakness and absence of a number of management tools. On the basis of these three factors, I would like to put forward three proposals for recovery: firstly, regarding imperative comodality; secondly, concerning the need for the Community method to respond to such challenges; thirdly, and naturally at the heart of our concerns, relating to the rights of passengers, which are central to our concerns. As regards the first element, the crisis has highlighted the fact that it was absolutely crucial to strengthen comodality in European transport, since the cloud highlighted the limits not only of aviation systems at European level but, more especially, of rail travel, since countless travellers were unable to find an alternative. As demonstrated in the studies that have been carried out over the last year, one can image that, with more comodality, the scale of the crisis would not have been so huge and the paralysis would have been somewhat less. As regards the second element, as in the financial crisis and in the debates we are having on the Community method compared with intergovernmental operations, here, in the area of transport, intergovernmental operations or a fragmented response from 27 Member States are not what will resolve the difficulties we have encountered and which may return, but rather a genuinely Community method. That would require strengthening the competences of Eurocontrol in a Community system and, of course, as has been pointed out, completing the Single European Sky as a matter of urgency. Thirdly, there are the passengers, who are at the heart and the centre of our concerns. As I said in my introduction, you will have gathered that what I left until last was the crucial issue."}

The world has heard the chants of ‘Women, Life, Liberty’ – three words that have become a rallying cry for all those standing up for equality, for dignity and for freedom in Iran. So let today’s prize serve as our tribute to the brave and defiant women, men and young people in Iran who, despite coming under increasing pressure, are leading the push for change. The European Parliament hears you, the world sees you and we are with you."}

We have to be very clear that the report by the Court of Auditors revealed that more than 95% of the EU budget is spent correctly. It is very important to take that into account. We also have to take into account that in 2012, the Commission corrected 3.2% of the spending made in the Member States. Just add up to 95.2%, the figure which I just presented and you will see that really we have a relatively good system in dealing with EU spending. We should not forget that the Court said very clearly that the accounts of the Commission are clean and that they present a true picture of the accounting system in the European Union. Of course, we have weaknesses, and I acknowledged that very clearly in my introductory remarks. And of course we have to address these weaknesses in a proper way. But we also have to work and to act within the legal framework which we have and which was adopted by the co-legislators, namely the European Parliament and the Council. We cannot invent actions which are not foreseen in the existing legal framework. Thanks to our joint action in the preparation of the legislative framework for the next programming period, we really are moving in the right direction and will be able to better address problems related to errors, particularly in the area of shared management. Actually, all of you who spoke today said that we still face problems in shared management. We have to tackle those problems. First of all, a very important tool is the net financial correction, which was agreed during the negotiations. We are working with the rapporteur on how to introduce this new instrument in the most efficient way and to use it in a targeted way in order to address serious problems. We should also remember that we introduced in the Financial Regulation management declarations of the Member States. Member States will now have to present these declarations to the Commission and to this Parliament. We are working in close cooperation with Jan Mulder on the design of national declarations and I and am a strong supporter of this approach and believe that the working group which we established together with this Parliament, and together with the Council, will provide good ideas on how we can better use this instrument at national level too. We should also remember simplifications which we introduced in the new legal framework, and it is very important that Member States use those simplifications in the correct way. The report of the Court of Auditors this year clearly revealed that in those cases where Member States use already existing simplification instruments, the level of error is negligible or even non-existent, so I think that it is very important that we encourage Member States to use these simplifications. Mr Gerbrandy raised the issue of performance, and I think that the new programming framework really addresses very thoroughly the performance management issues. The programmes in shared management are based on performance criteria, and of course the Commission will pay due attention in order to ensure that Member States establish smart performance indicators. We will monitor the implementation of those performance indicators. It is our common objective to ensure that EU spending is based on performance and not just on input. Having said that, I want to stress once again that we are taking the report of the Court of Auditors very seriously. We have analysed very seriously their findings and are preparing the implementation action plans for the Court’s recommendations. I believe that working together with this Parliament, together with the Court of Auditors, we will ensure better spending of EU money."}

So then, maybe it is time to act as well, and that is going to be the key. Up to now Europe has just had plans on the table there are insufficient to meet the Paris goals. We all know that. We have to do more. So, Commission, when you are reading Parliament’s resolution, please also note that we are demanding for next year a low emission strategy for 2050, because we need this long-term planning. After the facilitative dialogue next year, we need new NDCs in Europe where we are increasing our action. Only then will we be the leading continent on climate action which we claim to be. But it is not only about numbers and targets. This is about our future economy, and I say this to our nationalist friends on the right who are always very proud of what we can achieve as a country but then suddenly when it is about climate action, suddenly they say we are little, we are small, it does not matter what we do. Come on, stay on and be consistent! This is about our future economy. If we take the lead, the jobs will be here. If we do not take the lead, we will suffer from climate change and will have to import the technologies from all those regions that you so much fear. So be clever and take action now!"}

The Energy Charter Treaty is a multilateral trade and investment agreement applicable to the energy sector which was signed already 30 years ago, in 1994, and entered into force in 1998. The Treaty sets up a framework for international cooperation in the energy field between its contracting parties. Nevertheless, since 1998, the Treaty has not been substantially updated while the EU’s investment policy and energy and climate goals have been updated. As a consequence, in 2018, the EU and its Member States called for a modernisation of the outdated Treaty and carried out the negotiations between 2019 and 2022, in order to align the Treaty to Union law and policy, notably on investment protection and energy and climate goals. Whereas the negotiations were successful in modernising the Treaty, despite efforts on all sides, the Council unfortunately did not back the Commission proposal on the adoption of the modernised Energy Charter Treaty at the end of 2022. In the meantime, some Member States started the process of withdrawing from the treaty. Italy, France, Germany and Poland have already left, and Luxembourg, Portugal and Slovenia are in the process of withdrawal. Remaining in this Treaty exposes the Union to the adverse impact of an unreformed Treaty, which is incompatible with our energy and climate goals, as well as the principle of autonomy of Union law. In view of the situation, in July last year the Commission proposed for the Union to withdraw from the Treaty. Parliament also supported the Union’s withdrawal from the Energy Charter Treaty in its resolution on of 24 November 2022. The Commission’s position was to ensure a uniform withdrawal of the EU and all Member States jointly, in view of the exclusive competence on investment that the Treaty covers and the coherence of our international representation, including to uphold our energy and climate goals. Mindful of the urgent need to ensure a swift withdrawal from the nature of the treaty, in March this year, the Commission made a complementary proposal to allow the modernisation of the Energy Charter Treaty. This proposal makes it possible to unblock the current stalemate and ensures swift withdrawal of the EU from the Energy Charter Treaty, but also shortens the sunset clause significantly. Following the EU’s withdrawal, the Commission – in its right of initiative – would discuss and assess the conditions and modalities for individual Member States to remain in a modernised treaty. Against this background, both the EU withdrawal and the modernisation proposal should move in parallel and be adopted by the Council as a package, if the European Parliament gives its consent to the proposal for the Union withdrawal from the Treaty. I welcome the positive vote in the joint INTA and ITRE committee to recommend to the Parliament to give its consent to proceed with an EU withdrawal from the Treaty that is not aligned with our energy and climate agenda. The Union remaining in this Treaty is not an option. I am looking forward to your debate and to the vote tomorrow."}

It is, of course, reasonable if there is a broad consensus in the relevant committee on the substance, but, in this case, on the most important parts of this matter, there were only three votes that made the difference. That is not enough. There should also be a reflection of what is voted on in committee and in other opinion-giving committees, which again is not the case here, as the outcome does not reflect, for example, the Transport Committee’s vote. Essentially the issue is, of course, less about how much information truck users should give away to help us know how much CO2 emissions they produce and more about how much information they should give away so that Chinese competitors can get their upper edge. The principal question, which is probably more important, is that the European Parliament plenary should decide on the mandate for the European Parliament to enter into negotiation and should not regularly delegate that decision to the Environment Committee, or any other committee for that matter. Therefore we should vote against entering negotiations on the basis of this mandate without scrutinising it."}

Tomorrow, we are due to vote on discharge for nine joint undertakings. The reports follow the ECA annual report for the 2022 financial year and the individual annual reports on the joint undertakings and present some observations to improve their sound financial management further. Joint undertakings can be set up under the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU or Euratom Treaty as public-private partnerships between the EU and industry, research groups and Member States. They play a crucial role in groundbreaking EU research, development and demonstration programmes aiming at bringing the EU to the forefront of sustainable development in the world and responding to European social challenges that are currently insufficiently served by industry. The JUs operating under the 2021-2027 MFF implement their specific research and innovation agenda in sustainable transport, fusion energy, health, circular bio-based industries, key electronic components, supercomputing and network systems. Each has a distinct legal personality and adopts its own financial rules in line with the Financial Regulation, and they operate under the Euratom and Horizon Europe programmes. On 15 November 2023, the ECA published its specific annual report on JUs in the form of a consolidated report. Overall, the Court’s audit of the JUs for the financial year ending on 31 December 2022 confirmed similar results reported in previous years. In the annual process of granting discharge, we endorse the ECA’s recommendations and conclude that all accounts of the joint undertakings are reliable, in accordance with international accounting standards, and with low risk to the legality and regularity of revenues and payments. Nevertheless, through the reports, we would also like to highlight some further improvement in the coming financial years, in particular the need for improvement in programme implementation, human resources, and management and control systems. Given the systemic errors for declared personnel costs, we asked the JUs to strengthen their internal control systems for payments, especially by those beneficiaries that are more prone to errors, such as SMEs and newcomers. Regarding the risk expressed by the ECA in relation to the costs and deadlines for the ITER project in which Russia participates, we advise to remain attentive to events that may affect the implementation of the programme and exploring alternative supply flows should delivery problem arise. ITER is truly a groundbreaking programme with the ambition to produce unlimited energy on Earth. However, since the war in Ukraine, Russia’s membership has proven unreliable and very problematic as regards the delivery of components and risk of inflated costs. Therefore, we stress that this situation presents a high risk of delays and higher costs for the ITER project, where the EU takes the lead with more than a 45% share of construction costs. To conclude, I am fully convinced that all JUs represent successful European undertakings. All of them are operating within the merits of common rules."}

It was a good summit, it was pragmatic and constructive in character and it confirmed Russia’s desire for a stronger relationship with the European Union. At the summit, we launched the Partnership for Modernisation. As honourable Members know, a constant theme in President Medvedev’s time in office has been his recognition that Russia must modernise. The EU – as Russia’s most important trade partner and biggest investor – is a natural partner in this. Our approach is clear: to be successful, any drive to modernise must take a broad approach. It must encourage innovation and entrepreneurship, but also strengthen democratic values and the rule of law. This is why the effective functioning of the judiciary, the fight against corruption and dialogue with civil society are priority areas for the Partnership for Modernisation. As the EU has in the past, we raised concerns about the day-to-day situation for human rights defenders and journalists. The demonstrations on 31 May in Moscow were an example of the difficulties that continue regarding the constitutional right to freedom of assembly. Growing instability in the North Caucasus is another area of concern. But there have been positive developments too, and it is important we acknowledge them: the extension of the moratorium on the death penalty and the ratification of Protocol 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Work on the rule of law and fighting corruption will also contribute to a more business friendly environment. Investment flows to Russia have fallen off, and Russia understands it must do more to attract investors. Joining the World Trade Organisation fits with this broader strategy of strengthening rules-based processes. The EU backs Russia’s early accession and we hope that the work to do so can be completed soon. Political commitments to open trade must be translated into reality. The implementation of the Russia-Kazakhstan-Belarus Customs Union has raised some concerns. We have no issue with customs unions in general – the EU is a customs union – but we are concerned when these hinder trade rather than promote it, as appears to be the case with the proposed customs union. On energy, our discussions focused on physical infrastructure, on the legal basis for our energy relations, and on energy efficiency. The Partnership for Modernisation will have a big part to play here. We need to see solid energy provisions in our new agreement, reflecting the principles of the Energy Charter Treaty. We also underlined that we see the Energy Charter as the most natural forum to discuss proposals for a multilateral energy security framework. Energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gases are key in the fight against climate change. We encouraged Russia to be more ambitious on targets (currently 15%-20% compared to 1990 levels), and we will continue our efforts in the run-up to Cancún. On visas, Russia is keen to proceed quickly, but it understands the internal context on this sensitive issue in the European Union. The EU underlined the need to move step-by-step, in a results-oriented approach. We have tabled a concrete proposal to this end and will also look again at our Visa Facilitation Agreement. We hope that bilateral agreements on local border traffic can be concluded with both Poland and Lithuania which would help Russians living in Kaliningrad. We also discussed crisis management cooperation, with both sides underlining the good experiences of EUFOR Chad and EU Navfor Atalanta. We agreed to see if we could develop this cooperation further. Russia handed over concrete proposals, which we will examine. Obviously, the EU decision-making autonomy must remain intact. The summit was also an opportunity to discuss a number of international issues: the Middle East peace process, the Iranian nuclear programme, Afghanistan/Pakistan, Kosovo, the Eastern Neighbourhood, as well as broader European security. I was pleased with the joint statement that Foreign Minister Lavrov and I made on the loss of life during the Israeli military operation against the flotilla sailing to Gaza. However, and as expected, our views diverged on Georgia, Kosovo and Moldova, where we heard well-known Russian positions."}

Some of it comes directly from Russian open sources, so there is no point in denying it. A second observation I would like to make is that there are no ample references, due to the title and the subject of the report, either to the legal aspects – which have been touched upon by some of my colleagues – or to the human rights situation, as has also been mentioned here. All I would like to say here is that there were no human rights problems before, when Crimea belonged to Ukraine; but now there are, after Crimea was annexed illegally by Russia, with the Tatars. So I think we should bear that in mind. Some of our colleagues have mentioned that the NATO enlargement, which was disrespecting a pledge made to Mr Gorbachev – it was mentioned that he said so – was the cause of what has happened with respect to Ukraine. I would say that even the vision of Mr Gorbachev that there was a pledge that NATO should not enlarge is ignoring the sovereign will of the countries, because we wanted to get into NATO. Probably he meant to say that NATO should not have accepted our decisions, but that is exactly what the Warsaw Pact used to be like. I participated in one of the last meetings of the Warsaw Pact and I participated in NATO, so I know the difference between them. Anyone coming into the Chamber – probably visitors up there – and listening to our debate would believe that we have seen two different movies. We saw a movie in which Russia is occupying foreign territory through force and transforming it into a stronghold. Others have seen a poor, defenceless, peace-loving Russia defending itself against conquest by NATO and the EU. That is not acceptable. Russia has only two sticks – not a carrot and a stick – one bigger stick and one smaller stick – and the favour done by Russia means being beaten with the smaller stick."}

This is an utterly negligible number: just over 1% of the resident population of the European Union. It is clearly a problem that has been over-exaggerated. These are workers who perform useful services, such as personal services and work in the tourist industry and, in the vast majority of cases, they have been absorbed by the job market. These are workers who are useful to our economy, but they are exploited workers – exploited to reduce labour costs and to enrich unscrupulous employers. These are workers who often do jobs not performed by EU citizens. We need these people, but they have entered Europe illegally for a simple reason, which is that there is no legal way for them to come in. The same thing happened to the great majority of citizens whose situation is now legal but who entered the European Union illegally. What was needed was another measure: one that regularised the situation of these millions of people. What was needed was a measure to free them from slavery, blackmail and exploitation. Instead we have a directive that carries on where the Return Directive left off. First we decided on the expulsion procedures; today we are deciding on the potential expulsion catchment area and are even specifying who will pay for the expulsions. With this directive, the exploited pay more than the exploiters. Unfortunately, there is no provision for a general regularisation measure, not even for those who report their own status, or who report their exploiters or the crime that is being committed. They go straight from being exploited in illegal work to being expelled. We needed something different. We needed a measure to favour legality, and not the criminalisation of those who are currently here illegally. We needed a measure to curb xenophobia. Yesterday, the Italian Minister for Home Affairs said specifically, ‘We have to be hard on illegal immigrants’; in other words, we have to be hard on the vulnerable. I believe we are fostering this kind of xenophobic attitude with this directive. We in the European Union need immigrants – the Commission says so itself: 50 million by 2060 – because we are in the middle of a demographic crisis, but we are doing nothing to help them enter. Instead, we are harmonising the expulsion system and today we are deciding to expel those who are here illegally even though they may be workers who have been absorbed into the European job market. I think the effects of this directive will be devastating, because it will make immigrants and the job market go even further underground and increase the exploitative crimes of unscrupulous bosses."}

This early harvest is important for at least two reasons. First, it will provide banks with the option to phase in the impact of enhanced expected credit-loss provision. It will also address a specific issue that some Member States have with regard to exposure to the public sector denominated in a currency other than their own under the large exposure rules. Second, it will provide these solutions on time. Subject to Parliament’s agreement, the proposed solution will become available to banks from 1 January 2018 onwards. That is when the IFRS 9 financial instruments become mandatorily applicable and when the existing transitional agreements under the large exposure rules are set to expire. At this point, the impact of IFRS 9 on capital raises may be relatively limited for the majority of banks. However, nobody will really know the impact until the standard is applied. More importantly, nobody knows what the effect of IFRS 9 would be should the economic situation suddenly deteriorate. It is from this ‘better safe than sorry’ perspective that the Commission included a five-year transitional regime in the proposal. This will work as a safeguard against unexpected sudden adverse impacts on bank capital raises, due to a new accounting approach on credit risk provision. The Commission, like Parliament, considers that the dynamic approach would be a more effective safeguard against unexpected deterioration of the economy than a static approach, whereby the amount of add-back would be determined as a point-in-time number. The final political agreement with the Council was on a static approach, but with the dynamic top-up that, thanks to the Parliament’s perseverance during the negotiations, is not subject to any threshold. So, overall I consider that the outcome of the agreed approach will constitute an effective safeguard for the next five years. The adoption of this transitional package is a temporary safeguard. It does not undermine the longer-term risk-reduction benefits of IFRS 9. Enhanced expected credit risk provisioning will lead to earlier and higher provisioning against credit-risk buybacks. IFRS 9 will help prevent the build-up of stock of new non-performing loans with insufficient provisioning. Unlike in the case of IFRS 9, we know what the potential impact would be of failing to put in place a suitable solution for the treatment of public sector exposures denominated in a non-domestic currency under the large exposure rules. For Member States which are not part of the euro but which issue a lot of their public debt in euros, not finding a solution would mean that banks would either have to increase significantly their capital or sell a significant amount of their sovereign bond holdings. That would have the potential to distort the market for government bonds in those Member States. This is why the Commission proposed to provide for a specific arrangement to mitigate such an impact. I welcome the fact that the political agreement reached by this Parliament and the Council is very close to the Commission’s proposal. Parliament’s vote on this matter can demonstrate that the European legislative construct is capable of delivering important regulation within a short time frame. We have accomplished important work to agree on a final text. I want to take this opportunity to thank Parliament, and in particular Mr Roberto Gualtieri and the rapporteur, Mr Peter Simon and the shadow rapporteurs. Your work on this file can deliver an early harvest from the negotiations on the banking package. I hope this will also be a prelude to an agreement on the full banking package, for the sake of financial stability and economic growth in the EU."}

The European Union indeed needs to play its part to secure a safe passage for commercial ships, to prevent a further increase in commodity prices in the region, and to ensure that the merchant vessel Galaxy Leader is freed, including its crew, among them EU citizens. To be honest, I'm a little surprised that it took the Council so long to come up with the proposal for an EU mission and hopefully a positive decision will be taken soon. But Commissioner, I was also surprised that you were not sharing any information on this with us here today. So do we really need to rely on political leaks to get the information? What is planned, what the process is, when the mission will be happening. So, maybe in your concluding remarks you could share some more information. At the same time, we have to make sure that the Yemeni people, who have been suffering from war, massive violence, escalation and a humanitarian crisis for 10 years will also be seen and will also be important in our response. I was in Yemen in December as the head of a delegation of this Parliament, and I can tell you, Yemenis want nothing more than this catastrophe to end. And we need to make sure that their voices are also heard in the ongoing debate, that their needs are taken into account when setting up our joint EU response, because otherwise the long-term effects of our policy in the region would be detrimental. Colleagues, allow me to make one more additional remark. All the drones and missiles that are being fired at merchant ships, or in the direction of Saudi Arabia, or even trying to target Israel, they were manufactured in Iran, they were transferred to the Houthis by the Revolutionary Guards, and no one will be able to bring peace to this region unless we finally dare to revise our Iran policy, to take a stance, to revise our relations with this brutal regime and to take a clear stance against the Revolutionary Guards. We must call them and treat them as what they are: a terrorist organisation terrorising its own citizens and the whole region."}

Sometimes, a lot of the time, they’re outside school, and they’re with their parents and with other people who might not know or might not understand exactly what they’re doing on the internet. Because of that, I think it’s so important to educate parents as well. As the father of three children brought up in this era where it seems there is a preference for choosing the small screen, as opposed to the massive screen when you take your head away from it, I would be worried about it. A bit like fire, you can play with fire and you can get burnt, but you can do good things with it as well. We are at the moment playing with fire. I’d be worried about all the anxiety it seems to be causing for children. I’d be worried about how it seems to be making them less happy.

The common fisheries policy is fair for some, but not for all: 85% of the fish that’s taken out of Irish waters is taken by countries other than Ireland, with Ireland getting 15%. When it comes to reciprocal arrangements with third countries, they are worth about 60 million to third countries, but Ireland gets approximately 1 million in return. When it comes to processing those fish, many of the European fish go to Iceland and the Faroe Islands to be processed there, losing the opportunities of the multiplier effect in the local economy in Ireland. And finally, this has all been compounded by Brexit: 40% of the value of fish transfers to the UK came from Ireland; 15% of Irish quota was lost to the UK. The common fisheries policy in many ways serves unsustainable fishing by Norway, Iceland and the Faroe Islands at the expense of countries like Ireland. It’s a common fisheries policy for countries outside the EU and not for some countries within the EU, and we need to ensure that it’s much more sustainable, and we have to make sure that the opportunities that are there are for European fishermen in particular."}

Cybersecurity means safety and security for any interconnected device, service or phone, be they smart devices or smart washing machines, smart home systems, or online payment services, the online services that governments puts at citizens’ disposal, and even the European Parliament’s system and website, as well as the cars we drive, or metros and railways. Everything is interconnected and interoperable and could be hacked. Technological progress, new technologies and the internet of things potentially mean hundreds more devices going online and being interconnected in the near future, with cyber threats then having the ability to endanger on a greater scale and with a greater impact. Moreover, the COVID-19 crisis has again exposed the cyber vulnerabilities of some critical sectors, particularly healthcare. The associated measures of teleworking and social distancing have increased our dependency on digital technologies and connectivity, while cyberattacks and cybercrime – including espionage and sabotage, as well as malicious and unlawful ways of entering and manipulating ICT systems, structures and networks – are increasing in number and sophistication across Europe. To address these challenges we need resilience. We need to become less vulnerable to attack and, in the case of a threat or even an attack, we need a quick response mechanism. The EU looks more determined to fight these challenges. Securing network and information systems in the European Union is essential to keeping the online economy running, safeguarding the competitiveness of our industry, and ensuring privacy and prosperity for our citizens, securing their data privacy as well. The European Union is working on a number of fronts to promote cyber resilience. We welcome the initiatives announced in the EU’s cybersecurity strategy for the digital decade, but also note the evolution in the nature and sophistication of cyber threats, the risk of fragmented regulation and opportunity to strengthen our industry. We would therefore call on the Commission to promote the development of secure and reliable network and information systems, infrastructure and connectivity across the Union with a framework laying down horizontal cybersecurity requirements that would also aim to harmonise national measures and avoid fragmentation of the single market. Therefore, it is essential to further assess the need to propose measures at Union level introducing cybersecurity requirements for applications, software, embedded software and operating systems by 2023, building upon the EU acquis on risk management requirements. Digitalisation should happen with cybersecurity embedded, and for this, we need to further invest in innovation as well. The new European Cybersecurity, Industrial Technology and Research Competence Centre, based in Bucharest, will aim to retain and develop the cybersecurity, technological and industrial capacities necessary to secure the Union digital single market and will be of paramount importance for creating an interconnected Europe-wide cybersecurity, industrial and research ecosystem. Therefore, the Centre needs to start its activity as soon as possible. We would welcome on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE Committee) concrete answers from the Commission to the following questions: How and when does it intend to draw up a regulatory framework for ensuring that connected products and associated services, including supply chains, are secure by design, resilient to cyber incidents, and can be quickly patched up when vulnerabilities are discovered? Does the Commission plan to tackle the need to introduce cybersecurity requirements for applications, software, embedded software and operating systems? What concrete steps will the Commission take to strengthen the EU’s strategic autonomy in cybersecurity, namely by reducing its technological dependence and skills gap? How is the Commission planning to ensure that EU funds are spent in a synergetic way to achieve these goals? And finally, what actions will the Commission take in order to improve the cybersecurity of the core of the Internet while keeping it free, open and neutral?"}

We are also hypocrites, as we focus attention narrowly on our direct carbon emissions whilst ignoring the CO2 embodied in the goods we consume that have been imported. The European Green Deal is pointless if we do not combine it with an enlightened trade policy. Brazil’s President Bolsonaro saw the provisional Mercosur agreement as a green light to invite ranchers to destroy the Amazon and murder its indigenous people.

Unlike the rapporteur, I am still firmly in favour of the citizens having the right to choose initially whether or not their data should be inserted in public directories and whether or not they wish to receive unsolicited communications. I am pleased to note that this is the position of both the Commission and the Council, which have also proved willing to achieve compromise solutions that go some way towards meeting some of the more reasonable demands of telecommunications undertakings. That is why Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi and I have supported new compromise amendments. If these amendments are adopted, we will, at last, after tomorrow’s vote, have a new major directive which will help to develop the electronic market while safeguarding the citizens’ fundamental rights. To this end, we also had to find a solution which was acceptable to the Council to the issue of retaining data for the purposes of protecting national security. In my country, Italy, these data are kept for five years. Article 14 of the present directive already stipulates that the Member States can adopt legislative measures seeking to limit the confidentiality rights in respect of communications necessary for the safeguarding of national security. The solution laid down in compromise Amendment No 46 adds that, in accordance with the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights, these measures must be appropriate and proportionate within a democratic society, that data retention is only admissible for a limited period, and that the legislation on the subject must comply with the principles contained in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union and therefore, in particular, with those enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights and in the shared constitutional traditions of the Member States which are now – these traditions – included in the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights. Like all solutions which have to strike a balance between different interests, this one has to be assessed in the overall context. I feel that the solution is sensible and sustainable, for the European Parliament certainly does not have the power to make the Council prevent the Member States keeping traffic data for reasons of national security. We cannot prevent this; what we can do is provide a framework of guarantees and certainties safeguarding fundamental rights so that future legislation has to respect them."}

As regards an analysis of the factors which have promoted or hampered the social integration of young people, I believe it is essential to include an analysis of the role of the family or lack of family in the young person’s development. In the Council of Europe report on Coherent and Integrated Family Policies it states: “Families play a primary role in socialisation because they communicate the values, standards, customs and behaviour of the social group to which their children belong. Presumably a lack of family structure will also affect the child’s socialisation.” Whether a child is raised within or without a family, both circumstances will have a profound effect upon that child’s social development. Therefore reference to the role of the family should be, I believe, included in the European Community Youth Programme, which hopes to analyse the factors which have promoted or hampered the social integration of young people."}

In recent years, a number of international organisations have developed forward-looking plans, but they have not been implemented at Member State level due to a lack of binding power, of the prospect of potential sanctions and of appropriate budget allocations. The European Union is capable of ensuring the development, appropriate enforcement and assessment based on clear indicators of a non-mandatory Community strategy going beyond ‘soft law’ measures. As European Parliament rapporteur on the European Roma strategy, I believe that it is particularly important for the strategy to define the crisis areas within Member States which require immediate intervention. Social disadvantages are unevenly spread across geographical regions, with extreme poverty and social exclusion concentrated in certain micro-regions densely populated by Roma and non-Roma. This creates serious obstacles in the way of the social development of Europe. These regions should be removed from a competition which is unfair to them, and their development should be started by using intensive programmes adjusted to their own particular needs. In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the supervision and monitoring of the strategy should be the responsibility of local organisations. I also suggest extensive surveys on the needs of local target groups, similar to the agricultural projects in Ireland. In order to be able to evaluate the results of the programme, it is also indispensable to collect statistical data broken down by ethnic groups and evaluate them independently. According to the European People’s Party, these are the essential issues which the Córdoba Summit should address."}

The principles enshrined in the Pillar underline the importance to invest in people and to support them through changes stemming from new and emerging challenges. As President Juncker said, Europe’s social dimension should be given the Cinderella treatment no more but should instead be geared towards the future. Poverty and inequality are not only detrimental to social cohesion, but also to sustainable economic growth. This is why we believe that fit—for—purpose social protection systems can contribute both to the smooth functioning of the labour market and to inclusive growth. This includes, indeed, that minimum income provision has to be accompanied by activation measures and enabling services. An adequate income will always be important for maintaining human dignity and full participation in society and economy. It is important, however, to note that minimum income provisions are only one element in the whole policy mix that is needed to guarantee a decent life for the most vulnerable people in society. Now on Italy. Italy was one of the few countries not to have a minimum income provision for a long time. We recommended its introduction in country—specific recommendations for many years, and finally the previous government introduced it in 2017. We understand that the current government would like to modify the measure, including by extending its coverage. We will judge it, within the framework of the European Semester and the analysis of the draft budgetary plan, according to the well—established procedures you all know. Last but not least, Madam President, about the requests for new legislation, for instance on a minimum income directive or the other suggestions made during the debate, I can tell you that right now our focus is on the important legislative initiatives already proposed to implement the Social Pillar. Our goal is to see this completed within this mandate of the current Parliament. In parallel, there are important initiatives underway to ensuring upwards convergence in these areas, and here I am referring in particular to the recently agreed framework for minimum income benchmarking which includes indicators for defining adequacy of benefits. This will for sure be of great help to developing adequate minimum income schemes in all our Member States. Thank you very much for this debate."}

With an approved budget of over EUR 330 billion in the current programming period, cohesion policy is the biggest and most important investment tool in Europe. As 30% of both the Cohesion Fund and European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) will need to be spent on projects for decarbonisation of our economy, cohesion policy has a crucial role in tackling climate change. This is a chance our regions cannot miss out on. The next 10 years will design the way forward and the political possibilities for the upcoming decades. On 28 November 2019, the European Parliament called out a climate and environmental emergency. The European Green Deal and the commitment to a climate—neutral Europe by 2050 will require far—reaching reform for its agricultural, trade, transport, energy and infrastructure-investment policies. The coming years are especially crucial as we currently have already 1.2°C more average global temperature compared with the pre—industrial levels. The 1.5°C goal of the Paris Agreement might be reached by the end of the year 2027, and therefore within the cohesion policy framework of the next seven years. An increase of 1.5°C is the maximum the planet can tolerate. Should temperatures increase further beyond 2030 we will face even more droughts, floods, extreme heat, poverty for hundreds of millions of people and, of course, we may risk our long—term survival altogether. So how can our regions contribute to fighting climate change while using cohesion policy funds, and how can we best assist them? Just a few examples: by ensuring greater coherence and coordination between cohesion policy and other EU policies while improving the implementation of climate policies on the ground; by enshrining the ‘do no significant harm’ principle for all investment; by supporting holistic regional environment strategies and civic engagement while relying on the robust research and innovation process; by underlining the strategic role of renewable, sustainable and decentralised energy in the development of the EU regions and their enterprises; by investing further in sustainable mobility and the strong involvement of micro-, small and medium—sized enterprises in the transition process; and by acknowledging the specificities and potential of different regions, such as islands, which have become the front-runners in energy transition. We call on the Commission to monitor and publish reports using a common standard for all Member States about the progress of national governments and local and regional authorities in addressing climate change at all levels. I would like to conclude with one message that was the leading thought of this report. Climate change is not only a matter of the environment; it’s also a matter of economic and social change. Economic, social and territorial cohesion means, in this regard, putting a special focus on three elements: territorial cohesion with an understanding of the different needs of EU regions; economic cohesion with sustainable growth and green jobs respecting the needs of the different sectors; social cohesion with a just transition, social fairness and an understanding of energy poverty and special needs. The transition towards climate neutrality can only be reached in a socially fair and just pathway forwards, leaving no one behind."}
{"id": "1b0692b1-9c29-4b38-ad8d-09f90242a1c6", "text": "Mr President, good afternoon, colleagues, thank you, Herbert, for setting out the debate today. We are talking about the situation of wolves and other large carnivores in the European Union. And I do recall the resolution of this House of 24 November last year on the protection of livestock farming and large carnivores in Europe. The Commission submitted detailed replies on 7 March and we are making good progress on all of the elements set out in that reply. The wolf, the bear and the lynx are large carnivores that are native species here in Europe. They are part of Europe’s biodiversity and natural heritage, and we are all committed to their protection and conservation through European and international law. They play an important role, helping to keep ecosystems balanced and healthy. In practice, they help to regulate the density and distribution of overabundant wild species like wild boar or deer. Wolves remove the most vulnerable wild animals, which are very often diseased. And this in turn helps reduce the incidence of diseases that are transmitted to livestock. But of course, this is only one part of the story. It is clear that the return of wolves to regions of the EU where they have long been absent and the growth of wolf populations in new areas is a delicate topic. It is increasingly leading to conflicts with local communities and farmers. And this is especially the case where measures to prevent attacks on livestock are not widely implemented. We fully understand the reality of attacks on livestock and we acknowledge the problem for the farmers concerned. So I want to stress that the Commission takes the problem of wolves preying on livestock very seriously. Mitigating the impact of wolf attacks on livestock is a priority, and indeed, it has been a priority for a long time – at the very start of the Habitats Directive and the LIFE programme. This goal has become even more prominent in recent years. More and more Member States are using the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development to support action and investment to prevent damage to livestock. For the period up to 2027, 15 Member States have included measures in their CAP strategic plans, providing concrete solutions for farmers and local communities, and many authorities provide full compensation to farmers whenever wolves or other large carnivores cause damage. But I do acknowledge that for farmers, when this happens, it is a traumatic event. To support national and regional authorities, in October 2021, the Commission published new guidance with practical tips on how to reconcile protecting wildlife with human activities. This also clarified the scope and conditions for derogations to manage the wolf and other species. Now, in parallel, we have had to make sure we base our policies on the most accurate and up-to-date information. So in March this year, the Commission committed to carrying out an in-depth analysis on wolves in the EU, taking into account all available scientific and technical data. And this analysis is now underway. It started in April in cooperation with Member States and stakeholder representatives in the relevant expert group. Last week we launched a new phase in our work. We broadened our data collection exercise in order to obtain a complete picture. We are inviting local communities, scientists and all interested parties to submit up-to-date data on wolf populations and their impacts by 22 September. And based on the analysis of all the collected data, the Commission will draw conclusions on the situation of the wolf in the EU. We will then decide on a proposal to modify, if appropriate, the protection status of the wolf within the EU and whether to update the legal framework to introduce, where necessary, additional flexibility in the light of the information we gather. So thank you for this debate and I look forward to your contributions."}

Let me now turn to the Intergovernmental Conference. I ask myself why in fact the governments summoned a Convention, when, even without one, they could still have had the age-old spectacle of the nations haggling over their interests. While the governments are turning the Convention draft inside out, we in this House have gone back to drafting resolutions, repeating ourselves, protesting against the eternal sameness of things, but to no avail, with neither a response nor even a serious debate to show for it. The question we should be asking ourselves is what we should be doing. The governments think they know what our response is going to be; we gave it to them after the partial failure of Amsterdam. It was, ‘this is better than nothing.’ Then, after Nice, where the failure was complete, we gave it to them again: ‘this is better than nothing.’ Now I have come to believe that a bad constitution is not better than nothing. We should make it plain to the governments that it is not they who are the masters of the treaties, but the parliaments and the people they represent, and that it is these who can bring this constitution down. We are then told in tones full of emotion that the dignity of every single Member State must be safeguarded. What about Europe’s dignity? Nobody said a word about that. I cannot imagine that the dignity of any single Member State demands that the principles of the separation of the powers and of the public nature of lawmaking be violated, or that the legislative council – the Convention’s big idea for greater democracy – be done away with. I cannot imagine that the dignity of a Member State demands that the undoubted legitimacy of dual majority be traded for the lottery of Nice. I cannot imagine that the dignity of a Member State means that more laws have to be passed in Council, or that more offences against parliamentarianism and the public nature of lawmaking are called for. That has nothing whatever to do with national dignity, which does not require an attack on Parliament’s budgetary rights. In the last debate, and in the corridors and behind the scenes, I have heard people calling for compromise. To hear Mr Méndez de Vigo speak about it, you would think it was about this House renouncing its loyalty to the Convention and setting out on the treacherous ice of compromise. We are offered compromises only when we are in retreat. We are offered negotiations only when democracy and the rights of Parliament are disputed. Nobody seems to me to be offering to negotiate concerning our demands over and above the Intergovernmental Conference. This time, we should make it plain that a bad constitution is not better than nothing."}

They were waving Polish and European flags because they passionately love Poland. They are committed to its European future. And they look at the European Union for help, for help to stop the current ruling party completely destroying what’s left of democracy and rule of law in Poland and jeopardising Poland’s place in the European Union along the way, because that is what is happening here. We see a regime in Poland that is so afraid of the opposition, so afraid of elections, so afraid of checks and balances that they need to resort to more and more extreme measures in an attempt to cling on to power at all costs. These are classic autocratic tactics. We have seen and discussed many of those here in the past. But the latest and most extreme example is the so-called Lex Tusk, clearly designed to remove the opposition from the playing field altogether. It’s the culmination of eight years of authoritarian system developed in Poland for those eight years, and it may officially be called a committee on Russian influence, but it should be called a committee on Russian inspiration. Because trying to remove, trying to make your political opponents disappear, that is exactly what Putin does in Russia. And if we want to prevent European Navalnys in the future, we need to act now. And I thank the Commission, Commissioner Reynders, for acting swiftly and determinedly, because we must stand shoulder to shoulder with those in Poland that are fighting for democracy and rule of law, often at great personal expense. And we fully support the infringement procedure that the Commission initiated. And we welcome the sense of urgency with which you have done so, because we cannot overstate the urgency of this issue. Whatever smokescreen is being put up in Warsaw, the law is signed and enforced. And if we don’t act strong enough, if we don’t act quick enough, the damage will be done and it will be too late for repairs. We must do everything in our power to prevent that from happening, and we call on the Commission, therefore, to also strongly consider to take interim measures in parallel to the infringement procedures because there is simply no time to lose."}

When it comes to the migration crisis, I have no doubt that today we are at a very critical moment regarding the implementation of our decisions. But this is perhaps the first time when I feel that this is a critical juncture for the political system in Europe. The EU is based on an assumption that all Member States are ready to act with goodwill and to respect our common decisions. Without this method and this determination, our work has no meaning. You are absolutely right. What is most critical today is that I have no problems reaching compromises at the level of the European Council. On the contrary, it is too easy to achieve compromise, but the next day almost no one is ready to respect our common decisions. This is a really critical moment, not only because of the matter of immigration, but for Europe as a political organisation. It is truly difficult to discipline Member States today. Neither I nor the Commission receives much thanks. I am sorry to say that if the first principle – that we are ready to respect each other and our decisions – is not respected then we will have a huge problem implementing anything at all. Maybe this is because the scale of the challenge is so unprecedented. This is the very brutal truth. Neither Europe as an organisation nor the Member States were sufficiently prepared to face this completely new – in terms of numbers – problem concerning migration. This is true. I cannot agree with Mr Verhofstadt’s assessment when it comes to our discussion about external borders. I am sorry, but the discussion about the idea of strengthening our external borders is quite fresh. If you remember, as I do, at the beginning of our discussion about the migration crisis, there was a different topical issue, not external borders. I am really satisfied with what the Commission has done in strengthening the external borders and on the quite new idea about common external border guards in Europe. As you know, some elements of this idea are still controversial for some Member States, for many reasons. It is still quite a demanding challenge to explain and to convince them that we need this new and controversial – but absolutely necessary – new measure. What we need today is to solve some problems as quickly as possible. This is why it is my intention to dedicate the February European Council meeting to the issue of the UK. I hope it will be our last European Council meeting about it. But the February meeting will also be devoted to an assessment of implementation regarding the migration crisis and our action plan with Turkey. The next European Council in March will also concern the migration crisis. Esteban González Pons asked about Poland. As I said a few days ago at a meeting with the political groups here at Parliament, the EU has a right and an obligation to engage in a tough and open dialogue with the authorities of every EU Member State where the rule of law and norms of democracy may be violated. But please do not expect me to be happy and full of enthusiasm when the procedure on Poland is launched. You must understand that this is something really difficult for me. I know that the Commission acted in good faith. I have no doubt in that. We could discuss how some of the Commission’s measures, methods and decisions could have been tougher or softer. There was also a discussion within the Commission about timing and some procedural nuances, but the Commission took the decision. I am absolutely sure that this decision is an optimal one and I fully support it without any doubts. Believe me, seeking conflict between institutions, especially in this case, makes no sense. I am absolutely sure that we will continue to cooperate very closely also with regard to Poland."}

We decreased this dependency, but Russia was able to cover its financial needs in 2022 and 2023.

I also wish to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their diligent and dedicated work: Olle Ludvigsson, Sophia in ’t Veld, Ashley Fox, Eva Joly, Matt Carthy and Marco Valli. Payments, particularly cross-border internet payments, are essential for our single market. What is happening in the field of payments is a striking illustration of digital revolution. The original Payments Service Directive (PSD I) was adopted in 2007 and has proved to be an enormous success. It has brought real benefits to all stakeholders, especially consumers, with faster payments and clear refund rights, and it provided the legal basis for the Single European Payments Area. However, financial services have evolved since 2007. When the first PSD was adopted it created an opportunity for banks to provide payment services. These new players developed significantly to the extent that they are often the main innovators on the market. Now our mobile phone, our banking applications or a third-party provider may well be our favourite way of making payments. Digitisation, new players and new processes have brought real benefits to European citizens, but also new risks, notably in terms of security issues that have to be addressed. This is why the revision of the original Payment Services Directive is particularly timely. What does the second Payment Services Directive (PSD II) bring to the European payments market? Firstly, it allows for further technological developments and new market entrants while increasing security of payments to prevent fraud. Secondly, it introduces enhanced consumer protection, for example in the case of loss or theft of a payment card. Thirdly, taken together with the regulation on interchange fees adopted in May 2015, it reduces costs for both retailers and consumers and contributes to the creation of genuine EU-wide payment markets. New, safer and cheaper services have emerged in the area of internet payments. These services have developed massively in some Member States, overtaking cards for internet payments, and I trust this will rapidly happen elsewhere. Other services known as account information services allow consumers to have a global view of their financial situation and thus help budgeting and financial planning. The creation of a level playing field for newcomers and incumbents alike will ensure that all actors operate to the same standards under the same authorisation and licensing procedures. This directive represents a major step forward for the payments market in Europe. High security standards will need to be implemented by all payment services providers for electronic payment transactions. At the same time, security should not unnecessarily impair convenience. Some flexibility will be possible, in particular for low-value and low-risk payment situations. It will be the task of the European Banking Authority (EBA) task to prepare draft regulatory technical standards on security and the authentication of customers. The Directorate-General for Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union (DG FISMA) will work with Member States to ensure consistent transposition across the European Union and will hold transposition workshops starting early next year, 2016. I am very satisfied that the main objectives – competition, innovation and the development of the internal market in payments – are fully met in this text. I hope we have a very fruitful discussion, and once more I want to thank this House for the work done under the leadership of Vice-President Tajani."}

It could help us to fund the transition to a renewable energy future, and be a catalyst for making industry more sustainable. Indeed, the parliamentary report includes a Green demand to boost investment in sustainable industry. But the EIB is currently funding projects that do the reverse. In the UK, the Bank is investing GBP 500 million in the construction of incinerators, including the deeply unpopular incinerator in St Dennis in Cornwall. To stop such destructive investment, we are calling for stronger environmental assessment of projects and a full audit of the skills of EIB Board members to assess whether they are suitably qualified to make judgments about the environmental impact of projects seeking EIB funding."}

Tomorrow we will vote to endorse the interinstitutional agreement on the review of the Regulation and Directive on the Markets in Financial Infrastructure. The changes to both MiFIR and MiFID modify the rulebook governing participation in European capital markets, which play a fundamental role in channelling capital to the real economy. We need to ensure that our economy grows strong and remains competitive as there are long term challenges around. Europe requires more than EUR 500 billion of additional investment funding annually to ensure its sustainable competitiveness and resilience. This is not a mere financial challenge. It is a strategic imperative. Yet we remain dependent on bank-based financing while our capital markets are lagging behind. They are fragmented, which contributes to the inefficient allocation of capital. The once vibrant landscape of initial public offerings – IPOs – now stands at less than half the size of the US new listings. The US stock market's value relative to GDP is nearly twice that of the EU. Many in this House will remember that we embarked on building the Capital Markets Union back in 2015, but the project was tailored to the EU of 28 Member States with a major financial centre across the channel, and the focus was on national capital markets rather than on the removal of cross-border barriers. We need urgently to move away from fragmented capital markets and towards the idea of a capital market union. Advancing towards a truly single and vibrant capital market union is of fundamental importance for European open strategic autonomy. This context to the MiFIR and MiFID review, which had four key objectives: to reduce market fragmentation and market data costs; to harmonise and simplify the transparency rules; to enhance the levels of investor protection; and to increase the attractiveness and competitiveness of EU markets. I can proudly say that the text that we will vote on tomorrow achieves all these objectives. Thanks to the assertiveness of our House, for the first time, Europe will have a consolidated tape, a database designed to democratise access to market data and improve data quality by providing a continuous electronic live data stream on prices and trading volumes, consolidating the information obtained from multiple trading venues across the EU. It will reduce the fragmentation and cost of market data, will empower financial institutions and retail investors to observe in a single place the price and volumes for shares, ETFs, bonds or derivatives in the Union. The discussions on the consolidated tape were the most difficult part of the package, due to divergent views on the exact features that this new market infrastructure should have. In the review, we have also taken a careful look at the functioning of the market transparency rules in the Union, as well as in other jurisdictions. We put forward changes that seek to increase the competitiveness of EU firms, supported by the simplification and harmonisation of the transparency rules applicable across Europe. We have introduced greater flexibility in the framework by empowering the European Securities and Market Authority to set the thresholds and limits applicable to market transparency, and to oversee market developments, intervening when required. The harmonisation and simplification of transparency rules should strengthen the level playing field between all market participants and increase the overall transparency of European market structure. The report also mandates the Commission to carry out a holistic assessment of the financial markets legislation with respect to commodity derivatives, in light of the learnings from the energy crisis. To conclude, thanks to the efforts of the negotiating team, to whom I am really grateful for the openness, the final text contains many of the elements that the Parliament was calling for throughout the negotiations, and I believe that the final compromise represents a great victory not only for the Parliament, but for all those who care about the importance of the European Capital Markets Union."}

I hope they take some of the Madrid spirit along with them, because I’m sure they will have heard a lot of urgency from other governments of small island states, of coastal states and of countries and continents that are not as wealthy and prosperous as the European Union overall. So, I hope they take along that urgency and then put it and convert it into some real action, because after Madrid the real action has to start. As it stands right now, not a single one of the European Union Member States has submitted a national greenhouse gas reduction plan that would be adequate or in any way sufficient in order to reach the Paris Agreement targets. But the EU targets are also far from sufficient. In fact, they were agreed in 2014, so before the Paris summit. Clearly, we need to step up the game because, right now, Europe does not lead the game. We are looking elsewhere; we are telling other countries that they should do something. But that doesn’t work. We need to act ourselves; we cannot wait for others to act. A stable climate is not just a nice thing to have, it’s absolutely vital in order to have a liveable planet for the younger generation and also for future generations. It’s vital for security and for peace worldwide. And also, if we’re lagging behind, as we’re doing right now, we’re also losing out on technologies, on climate jobs that, right now, our competitors elsewhere in the world are developing. It is time to act and the Member States need to finally agree on the climate neutrality target of 2050. But, let’s be clear, and let’s keep in mind that that is not a very ambitious target. We should actually do much more to follow the Finnish example and be more ambitious, because 2050 is really late. But having targets for some time in the future is anyway not enough; we need to have concrete measures right now. We need to make sure right now that we will, at some point, achieve and reach targets. And what better way to use as a concrete measure our long—term budget? This is where we decide where we put our money, and we should put our money where our mouth is. That means that we should have a Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) that invests in renewable energies and in ecological agriculture and not, as it is foreseen at present, in agricultural mass production and in fossil fuels. We need to change our priorities. If we don’t change where the money goes, then nothing will change in terms of the actual policies. The EU has to play its fair part in a fair transition and that also needs resources for the European Union. Otherwise we have a lot of demands but not the resources to implement them. And that’s why we, the Greens, fully subscribe to the Parliament’s position of having at least 1.3% of the GNI as the overall amount. But on the income side we also need to be sustainable. A plastics tax or a carbon border adjustment tax is not just a revenue; it can really be a means of how to shape policies and make sure that we have policies that protect the environment and support a fair transition. And of all of these elements, the European Council can, but also really should, deliver. Because in order to stay credible, the EU has to lead with ambitious targets and we have to deliver them at home. If not now, when? So, I wish the best of luck to the Finnish Presidency and really hope that all the groups here can contribute by urging governments to actually play their role and say yes to climate neutrality, yes to an ambitious MFF and not just continue with business as usual."}

This budget procedure confirms the narrowness of the multiannual financial framework. The amount of payments, at less than EUR 130 billion, or 0.99% of GDP, is very skimpy and cannot support hopes for the development of European policy. The teamwork in the Committee on Budgets means that the budgetary priorities of the political groups can be maintained, but the financial framework prevents the revival of the growth policies promised to European citizens. Our committee took particular care over the choices made by all the parliamentary committees, but the proliferation of pilot projects is evidence of the frustration with the niggardly nature of this financial framework. Once again, we have had to fight drastic cuts by the Council and I am happy with the compromise secured. The Commission still needs to execute this budget correctly. We will no longer put up with this draft budget being denatured through failures to execute and transfers of appropriations back to the Member States. Firstly, in the 2008 budget, we do not accept the failure to use the cohesion funds. In the Socialist Party, we have restored the Council’s dreadful cuts that affected programmes such as Culture 2007, Media 2007 and Youth in Action. I do not need to remind you here of the importance of these lines as the new Treaty is being put to the people of Europe. I invite the Council to think about this; for example, giving research or Frontex the resources they need to operate, and improving the lines of information correspond to the current concerns of European citizens. We are also proposing additional appropriations for certain new projects to improve the capacity to accommodate refugees or for NGOs fighting discrimination. The European budget absolutely must continue to help those fighting the scourges afflicting European society. For the EU’s external relations, we are reducing the expenditure of the CFSP by 40 million because we have to honour our commitments and the EU’s commitments: to preserve the emergency aid reserve, help the most disadvantaged countries, support the Global Fund to fight AIDS, the World Health Fund and maintain development aid. For Kosovo and Palestine, the flexibility instrument will need to be mobilised to provide EUR 87 million. It is still to be deplored that heading 4 is systematically underfunded. World poverty is growing and our budget is shrinking. For the European Commission, I recognise that the reserve of EUR 40 million is harsh but it reflects our doubts over the effectiveness of implementing ABM. Allow me to give you a few examples: first of all, the failure to spend the cohesion funds, the impossibility of executing the pilot projects we hold dear, such as the Erasmus-style programme for apprentices, the lack of transparency in the choices of research firms, the poor implementation of selection competitions for new officials. The list is long and Parliament is asking to be convinced of the goodwill of the European executive. Finally, the main one, the asterisk amendment demands that Galileo and the EIT are funded beyond the ceilings of the financial perspective. This necessitates, forces even, a mini-revision of the financial perspective. Parliament cannot accept the endangering of Galileo, a major challenge from a technological, economic and political point of view, and an essential strategic tool for the political powers and independence of the EU, but I am convinced of the value of Mrs Merkel’s comments in our chamber. On 29 June, Chancellor Merkel used this African proverb to close her Presidency: ‘If you want to go quickly, go alone, but if you want to go far, go together.’"}

You did this in Durban, too, but I am nevertheless critical of the results. I would even go so far as to say that I think Durban was a fiasco. The reason I say this is as follows: the fact that we could not achieve anything better than a legal obligation to reduce CO2 emissions in 2020 does not mean that we should accept that. The problem with doing that is that, by doing so, we have in fact said to the rest of the world that we accept the fact that we will not have anything legally binding that can keep us below the 2 degree target before 2020. Everyone sitting in this Chamber and everyone following this debate via the web streaming or by other means and who is interested in the climate knows that this will be too late. If we are to keep the temperature rise to less than 2 degrees – and we must do that because if we go beyond 2 degrees there are a whole series of positive feedback effects that will kick in and then the process will be irreversible and we will not be able to do anything – we need to start within 5 years. All science indicates this, the International Energy Agency says this and it is difficult to find people who understand this matter who do not agree with this. That is why it was a fiasco, and therefore we need to say that we can no longer concentrate on solving this problem from the top down via the United Nations. There is now only one way to go about this and that is from the bottom up, and you also need to play a part in this."}

The European Green Deal spans across the EU from Romania to Ireland. But guess what?

This week sees the fifth anniversary – on 15 September – of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which triggered turmoil in the global financial markets. Some argue that the culture which caused the crisis persists in the financial world, particularly as instances of abuse continue to hit the headlines. These new rules on market abuse are therefore a cornerstone of the programme of financial reform and rehabilitation necessary to restore trust and confidence in the markets. They are essential to ensure that we tackle the problem of what one financial commentator has described as greed and finance getting the whip hand over judgment, prudence and probity. In July 2012, the LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) scandal was an illustration of greed and market manipulation of the worst kind: manipulation of the most crucial interest rate in global finance, which underpins around USD 350 trillion in derivatives and USD 10 trillion in loans. Regulators in the EU and London were caught unawares because the existing market abuse rules did not cover abuse of non-financial instruments and benchmarks. As a result, the imposition of large fines and the initial prosecution of the LIBOR scandal were carried out by the US regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), with individual traders being called to prosecution in the US by the Department of Justice. I believe the litmus test of our new market abuse rules will be whether we are able to use them to capture potential or emerging abuses and whether they are tough enough to be a deterrent and to sanction abusive practices. Surely none of us believes that the best way to serve justice in the EU is to extradite those who commit abuses to the US, where they face tougher sanctions and longer jail sentences? So the rules we are voting on today not only close the LIBOR loophole, but also extend the scope of market abuse rules beyond financial instruments to benchmarks and indices. This is particularly relevant and important amid press rumours and speculation that we are now seeing manipulation in energy markets – in the oil and gas sector – as well as potential manipulation in foreign exchange markets. These rules provide regulators with a range of tough tools, including more severe sanctions and penalties, a lifetime ban for those committing abuse, and essential protection for whistleblowers. They give regulators the tools they need to monitor, detect and prosecute market abuse, because we know that it is difficult to gather evidence of such abuse. So, colleagues, I ask you to vote to support these rules. They tackle serious gaps in the regulation of new markets, platforms and over-the-counter trading in financial instruments; close the loopholes for LIBOR, benchmarks, commodities and commodity derivatives; remove obstacles to effective enforcement for regulators; and introduce legal certainty to ensure their effectiveness and ensure that all market abuse can be subject to criminal sanctions. I am also pleased to report that, with these rules, we have taken the first step towards a system of cross-border surveillance. Given that regulators have informed us that in one case more than seven EU Member States were involved in information-gathering, I think this is a very important step forward. Finally, today’s vote sends a clear signal to those intent on committing market abuse that the EU is not a soft option or a safe haven. In fact, we have broad public support for the new rules that we will introduce with today’s vote."}

You do not want to make definitive statements because a definitive arrangement has not yet been worked out, but in the meantime, our citizens are already paying this levy. This is, of course, unacceptable. You must intervene, and in a very active manner. As has already been said many times by my fellow Members before me, it is astonishing to discover that the US authorities have found no better answer to the question of how to attract more visitors than by making these selfsame visitors pay an additional levy of USD 14. USD 4 of this is effectively to cover the costs of the Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA). In other words, they do not want to offload regular costs onto the US taxpayer: instead, they are passing them on to the Europeans. This is a first major departure from all the various aviation charges or airport taxes we, too, have introduced in a number of Member States, such as very recently in Germany. I regret these unilateral measures by a number of Member States; in fact, I am in favour of a European approach to this matter, which should ideally take on board aspects such as the external costs of the flights in question as well. However, this is about something else entirely. In Europe, there is no question of discrimination: everyone pays the bill, whereas in the case of the US, it is only we who pay it. And there are 900 000 of us Europeans who re-register every month via ESTA. We also need to take an in-depth look at whether the measure does not contradict the letter and the spirit of the Visa Waiver Programme. This programme essentially means that people on both sides do not need to apply for a visa, with all the associated costs. ESTA is gradually becoming synonymous with a visa. This is also what Mr Brok has just said. I would therefore ask you not to treat this lightly, not to procrastinate, but to send a very strong signal to our partners in the United States that this is unacceptable; that this is no way to deal with each other. All options should therefore be looked at, and if there is no flexibility forthcoming on the part of the Americans, we will naturally have to think about reciprocating. In that context, I can refer briefly to the efforts being made by Mr Tajani to get a European tourism policy off the ground. The Treaty of Lisbon has given us more say on this on a European level. Perhaps it would not be a bad idea to exchange thoughts on this over the coming months."}

In their Accession Treaties, it states that all other Member States must immediately or gradually open up their labour markets to Romanian and Bulgarian workers. The final transition period is about to start, a period in which only those countries which can prove a serious disruption to their labour market can apply transitional measures. There is now also a report – for which we are grateful to you – which suggests that those countries which did not introduce transitional measures have, in fact, benefited and that transitional measures have mainly negative effects. There is every reason, therefore, for all Member States to open up their labour markets completely to Bulgarian and Romanian workers. Unfortunately, a number of countries have announced that they do wish to impose restrictive measures, with the Netherlands being the most enthusiastic proponent of this ‘worst practice’. If Mr Kamp, Minister for Social Affairs, has his way, not a single Bulgarian or Romanian will be able to enter the Netherlands. This has nothing to do with the facts. Not only is it completely ridiculous that it is precisely in the Netherlands, one of the richest EU countries with the lowest unemployment rate, that it is being claimed that the labour market might be disrupted, but there are also all kinds of studies – in the Netherlands as well – that indicate that these measures encourage exploitation. Transitional measures mean sentencing thousands of EU citizens to exploitation, poor working conditions, fictitious self-employment and low pay. Transitional measures also mean that thousands of employers are unable to recruit the workers that they consider best suited to the work in their company. Transitional measures mean, as far as I am concerned, a violation of the right to freedom of movement and an infringement of the Accession Treaties if a country is unable to prove any serious disruption. You, Commissioner, are the Guardian of the Treaties. I expect you to perform this role not merely in letter but also in spirit. Therefore, as soon as you receive the notification from the Netherlands, I expect you to put the examination and the facts to one side and say: ‘Dear Mr Kamp, enough of this ridiculous fairy tale’. If you do not do this, then the Accession Treaties will not be worth the paper they are printed on. The Netherlands is constantly reminding Romania and Bulgaria of their obligations, and now it is failing in its own obligation under the Treaties that it itself ratified. If you let the Netherlands get away with this, then you are actually saying that domestic policy considerations come before the freedom of movement of workers. You are actually saying that the richer, old Member States can interpret the Treaties as it suits them, even if they then cause harm to their own workers and thousands of Romanians and Bulgarians."}

There has been talk here of simplicity, transparency and also of information campaigns, so that people can be aware that these instruments exist, for small and medium-sized enterprises, which often imagine the world of EU bureaucracy to be complicated and too far-removed. Indeed, in the report we also state that there is a need to publicise these financial instruments, that we need to train regional and local organisations, as well as banks and small and medium-sized enterprises, so that they are aware that these financial instruments are available and know how to use them. I would like to make a small clarification, because sometimes there are questions as to when the financial instruments are used or why subsidies can or cannot be replaced. There are three investment scenarios: one that is optimal, in other words the project is generating income and is low risk, and it should therefore be financed directly in the market. There is another situation in which projects have low profitability but clear added value; in this case we are precisely in the territory of subsidies. However, between these two situations there is a middle ground: when there is significant profit but not enough to access the capital or credit markets, and that is where the financial instruments come into play. The financial instruments cannot, therefore, under any circumstances, be substitutes for subsidies, nor can they, under any circumstances, create distortions in the market. Finally we would like to clarify that obviously, as Mr Murphy said, private investment has declined, and we have unfortunately seen how, in recent years, the capital markets have resorted directly to speculation. That is, however, precisely what these financial instruments aim to prevent, because they are going to help profitable projects that we consider to be strategic for obtaining finance, thus avoiding speculation."}

The issue of the Doha negotiations is far removed from most citizens, the media, and even many governments, which are now busy dealing with far more pressing financial and economic priorities. This is not a debate that truly excites Brussels, nor even, it seems to me, Geneva, at least not from what I have seen this year, both in the WTO Parliamentary Assembly and in its steering committee, of which I am a member. There is an air of resignation about the fact that nothing is happening now, that nothing must happen, that nothing can happen, that the challenges facing a better-regulated and more generous global market are too complicated, and that the boundaries between the opposing blocs – between emerging countries that regard themselves today as powers and the former powers of old, which are now struggling, countries in constant transition, with an identity crisis – are themselves always shifting and vague. In other words, the ship that the World Trade Organisation – and, therefore, we too – are aboard does not know where it is heading, because, as Seneca wrote, ‘If one does not know to which port one is sailing, no wind is favourable.’ In the meantime, Commissioner, the poorest countries are losing out: they were encouraged to comply with international trade rules, and a good 32 out of 48 of them have joined the WTO, but what good has it done them so far? Theirs is a paradoxical situation: they account for less than 1% of international trade, but have 12% of the world’s population, people who are often forced to live without access to basic services. The forthcoming Eighth WTO Ministerial Conference has a duty to adopt at least – I repeat, at least – a package of measures to help them, and yet we have received no guarantees on that score – anything but. We call on you, Commissioner, to look into this matter. Although it would have no significant impact on international trade balances, the poorest countries would benefit greatly from measures such as the introduction of duty-free access quotas for their products, the simplification of rules of origin, the introduction of measures to correct market distortions in sectors such as the cotton sector, the provision of technical assistance to internationalise their economies and – an extremely important requirement for us members of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe – the extension of the TRIPS waiver beyond 2016 for pharmaceutical products and data protection. As far as we understand, none of this has been agreed yet. I understand your disappointment, Commissioner – we are disappointed too. We support you and the Commission in your commendable efforts. If there is no prospect of meeting the needs of the poorest countries, then we can well imagine the situation regarding much more complex issues, such as the balance between emerging countries, the European Union and the United States. If I am not mistaken, Pascal Lamy today inaugurated work on the construction of the WTO’s new headquarters in Geneva: this is a first step, and I must say that the need for proactive and industrious efforts to revive the work programme, objectives and the identity of international trade itself has never been so great."}

This is also our obligation under the World Health Organisation’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and we fully respect it. First, the Commission has a very robust set of rules on ethics and integrity for Commission staff and on transparency. In particular, the Commission requires its top decision makers at political and administrative level to publish information on all meetings they hold with interest representatives. Minutes of all meetings are subject to document management rules and they can be subject to request for access to document. These rules are complemented by dedicated tobacco-specific arrangement and action supplied by the Commission services, with particular responsibility for setting and implementing public health policies with regard to tobacco control. These dedicated arrangement include limiting meetings with industry to those which are strictly necessary for the development of policy, and the publication of reports of all such meetings. Moreover, as recently indicated to the Ombudsman, the Commission has proactively initiated a process to ensure that directors, generals and heads of service as well as all heads of cabinet conduct an assessment of the exposure of their services to the lobbying by tobacco representatives in the context of health policies and policies related to tobacco control, and take necessary actions. Second, the EU tobacco traceability system aims to monitor and reduce the circulation of non-compliant tobacco products which can provide an artificially cheap source of tobacco products, thus impacting on public health, state budgets and legal economic operators. With specific regard to tobacco traceability, the Commission ensures that all data storage providers of the European tobacco traceability system, including Dentsu, comply with strict independence criteria. These criteria aim to ensure the absence of any conflicts of interest by the providers. Ensuring independence from the tobacco industry in both legal and financial terms is central to this policy. Third, I want to stress that the appointment of Dentsu in June last year as the secondary repositories operator in the tobacco traceability system followed all relevant rules and procedures, thereby ensuring transparency. The procurement documents for the relevant procedure have been prepared in conformity with the implementing regulation on the technical standards for the traceability system for tobacco products and with the principle of sound financial management. It is also important to note that the Commission can terminate the contract if the operator of the secondary repository fails to comply with the independence requirements of the implementing regulation, or fails to promptly communicate to the Commission and Member States any occurrences of threats or any other attempts at exercising undue influence that may actually or potentially undermine its independence. Altogether, all the elements I have highlighted concur to build a robust, comprehensive framework with high standards of transparency and accountability, and which is compatible with the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. Let me conclude by stating strongly and clearly: public health and transparency are priorities of this Commission and the Commission will continue to be fully committed to protecting public health policymaking from the influence of the tobacco industry."}

We all agree that the fight against corruption is an issue that concerns all of us as public representatives. It is an issue that certainly is not confined to certain Member States. It is one that affects every Member State and one that crosses borders and therefore needs a strong European response. A range of Members have talked about the risks of corruption eroding the democratic system. Ms Fajon, Ms Gräßle, Mr Schmidt and many others talked about the risks in terms of public opinion and in terms of public trust in the democratic system if we are not seen to take decisive action on the general issue of corruption and putting in place concrete steps to tackle it. One point that is important and I want to pick up on was raised by Ms Gräßle. It is that we set very high standards when we talk about enlargement and candidate countries, but in order for the European Union to be in a position to exert pressure on countries to reform and to meet the criteria, we have to be in a strong position ourselves. In other words, we have to adhere to the type of standards and the type of transparency that we talk about and that we insist upon during the accession process. A number of points have been made in respect of OLAF. I note that a range of Members have mentioned it. It is important to say that the Irish Presidency is very pleased at the fact that agreement was reached in Council in respect of the OLAF Regulation. I think this will help to address some of the concerns, at least, that have been raised by Members such as Mr Tavares. The revised regulation will help to increase protection of the Union’s financial interests, and that is very important for the credibility of the Union and the credibility of our financial instruments. If we can achieve agreement with Parliament, which I believe we will, and which is a priority for our Presidency, that can contribute very positively. One point in respect of the proposed directive on the fight against fraud to the Union’s financial interests: this is a priority for the Irish Presidency. I know that, within Council, some Member States have concerns about some of the details of the Commission proposal. However, I am absolutely confident that we will be able to reach agreement as there is very strong support for its aims. Developing a directive will add value to the fight against fraud, which is important and will meet the concerns of many of the Members of this House, so we will continue with that constructive process. We will work on the substantive issues, and look forward to engaging with Parliament in the very near future on that. Finally, I just want to reiterate our full commitment to working constructively with the Commission and with Parliament in strengthening all aspects of our anti-corruption policies at EU level. I have taken good note of the concerns and of some very constructive suggestions that have been made here during the course of this evening’s debate, and I want to say that as the Presidency we will certainly ensure that there is continuing and full cooperation and engagement with Parliament. I look forward to further and more detailed discussions in due course on a range of proposals."}

Political parties can be banned; there is corruption in the legal system; there are abuses of human rights; freedom of speech and association do not exist in the same way that they do in countries like Britain or most other European states. There is continuing persecution of a tiny Christian minority, which is – sadly – a growing feature of most Islamic countries. The reforms of Kemal Ataturk in the 1920s were to be applauded, as they sought to leave behind the antiquities of the Ottoman Empire and the worst of the Dark Age Islamic practices and to take Turkey forward into the 20th century. Even those achievements are now under threat as the worldwide ideological Islamic fundamentalist movement gains power, funded as it is by countries such as Saudi Arabia – courtesy of Western oil revenues – and ably assisted by the supine surrender of western civilisation. This debate, of course, is just another small step on the road to allowing Turkey to join the European Union. Turkish entry to the European Union is enthusiastically supported by the British Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democratic parties. They look forward to welcoming the hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of Turkish immigrants who will come to Britain if Turkey joins the EU. And just imagine if Turkey joins the European Union and uses such common legal procedures as the European Arrest Warrant. British voters should imagine their potential free trip on the Turkish Midnight Express courtesy of the Lib Dems, Labour and Tories, and vote accordingly. Sadly, Turkey wants to join the European Union because they will have their hands out in the hope of having them filled with lots of European taxpayers’ money in subsidies, and they see the opportunity of offloading millions of their poor and unemployed excess population by exporting them to Western countries like Britain, where they will either work for low wages or go on the benefits system. This is hardly a positive vision for a proud nation. I wish the Turks well and hope they achieve real democracy in time, but I also hope they will take the advice of the UK Independence Party not to join the European Union but to preserve their freedom and independence."}

The result is something of which Parliament can be proud. I would also like to give special thanks, on behalf of my colleague Mrs Niebler – who unfortunately cannot be here today, to the rapporteurs, Mrs del Castillo Vera, Mr Harbour and Mrs Trautmann, as well as to all the other people who have helped to pave the way for a compromise. It was a truly difficult task, sometimes involving a great deal of effort on the part of individuals and political groups, but in the end, a consensus was achieved. The telecommunications sector is a vital sector in terms of economic development, as it provides an important stimulus for employment. In 2007 alone, this sector had a turnover of around EUR 300 billion. This means that the sector will have a new legal framework, which will also have a big impact on economic development in the European Union. Europe faces significant challenges: investing in high performance broadband networks and expanding them. The business sector is ready to take action and we also want to open doors. An important decision has been made. Last but not least, we want to make the radio spectrum policy more flexible, and need to make use of the digital dividends. Here, too, an important prerequisite has been met. And finally, we have had to invest a lot of effort, as, at the beginning, many of us were not aware of the problems and the issue of how to deal with internet freedom and how to strengthen citizens’ rights on the internet. We have now secured the protection of our citizens to a far greater extent than we had imagined at the start of the process, as things have moved forward. Measures taken in the EU Member States in relation to access or usage of electronic communication network services must not infringe fundamental rights in any way. Limitations should only be introduced after a fair and independent process. The person must have a right to a hearing and be able to challenge the decision in the courts. This is an amendment that could not be foreseen at the beginning. Everyone contributed to this process, and I hope that everyone will therefore be able to vote in favour of the proposals. Thank you very much."}

Europe is the ideal of diversity, the rule of law, social justice and, above all, peace and democracy. A democracy that, for example, just in the previous debate, we can see where we are fighting for our political ideals rather than just for national interests, at least in principle. But our democracy has left some space for improvement. Over the last 40 years, we didn’t really update the foundations of how we vote, and over the last 15 years, we didn’t update the functioning of the European Union as such. Why? Because our national leaders don’t seem to care too much. If you look at it last year, we triggered the treaty changes and there was no real effect yet until now. No national leader really reacted. We triggered electoral law reforms and, again, nothing. When we look at the right of initiative, there’s also no improvement from the Council side and the same for the right of inquiry. But we should really safeguard our democracy and so I’m happy that at least on this side, when we now look at the rights of mobile citizens, of those citizens that move from one Member State to the next, we do see some improvement. And I do want to thank the shadows for the good cooperation in trying to strengthen their rights. What have we achieved in this report? We propose to the Council to allow for immediate registration so that whenever you come to a new country, you don’t leave your rights as a citizen of the European Union at the borders, but you can actually take them with you and exercise them easily. We want to make it more accessible to vote. So that means that we want to make information available in all languages. We want to make it easier for vulnerable and marginalised groups to vote. We want to make it easier for even people with disabilities, older persons, homeless people to cast their vote. It’s also important that we take note of what works well in different Member States. And so we also recommend to update electoral laws when it comes to postal voting, advance physical voting, proxy voting, mobile polling stations, and also electronic and online voting to make use of modern technologies. We do believe that it should be possible for everyone without derogation to stand as a candidate, as an EU citizen in the different Member States. And it’s now, I think, imperative that we stand together and try to put pressure on the national leaders to actually implement these rights. Because if you look at it, from the 11 million EU citizens who live in different countries right now, only a very marginal part actually stands as candidates. There’s a low voters turnout as well but it’s really striking that in the 2019 elections only over 1 % of the candidates were actually coming from a different Member State. We can do so much more. We can be a real transnational, pan-European democracy. But for that, dear colleagues, we really need to make sure that our strong results that we got in our negotiations are also implemented by the Council and that we do get a treaty change and that we do get an update of our electoral law in general."}

The associated legal and financial obligations, such as, observing standards on wages and working conditions, and, the payment of taxes and social security contributions are also thereby externalised to subcontractors and employment agencies. Worryingly, subcontracting may increasingly be used as a way of reducing direct social responsibility. Thus, the idea of ‘joint and several liability’ is crucial for ensuring that companies are responsible for their sub-contractors' practices. Clearly, the enforcement of legal obligations becomes more difficult in long and complex chains of interconnected companies. This is especially so across borders where various levels of contractors can be established in different Member States and subject to different rules. At the moment only eight Member States have national legislation covering the responsibility of subcontracting undertakings. I strongly support this ETUC endorsed report which calls on the Commission to establish a clear-cut Community legal instrument introducing joint and several liability at European level, and, also requests the Commission to launch an assessment of the feasibility of an instrument on chain liability as a way of increasing transparency in the sub-contracting process."}

Let me share with you the four most important tasks and areas that await us in the very near future and that are essential for this strategy to be a success in the end. Firstly, the institutional and coordination starting line is to be finalised. For this purpose, the Commission’s confirmation to Parliament at the end of October that, despite any political upheaval or budgetary hardship in Member States, it was expecting the national Roma inclusion strategies to be submitted by the end of this year was of great importance. The Commission also confirmed that, after a thorough evaluation covering the professional substantiation, complexity and financial feasibility of the national strategies, the Commission would also present specific recommendations for their revision, and would report annually on the progress of the integration to Parliament and to the Council. On 8 April 2010 in Budapest, Vice-President Reding promised that the Commission would keep a close eye on the actions of all the Member States and would not tolerate any window-dressing regarding the national strategies. Secondly, Parliament’s report called for the establishment of a so-called crisis map to identify and measure the under-developed areas which are struggling with serious structural disadvantages. This will enable complex and holistic development programmes for immediate intervention under the cross-sectoral integrated approach. I truly hope that the poverty mapping carried out by the Fundamental Rights Agency will fulfil these requirements. Thirdly, last year Parliament proposed serious and important changes to the next Multiannual Financial Framework in order to ensure that EU and national funds can contribute to the substantial and enduring improvement of living conditions for the Roma. Complex, flexible and sustainable programmes are necessary, with longer time coverage and greater territorial relevance, focusing on the most disadvantaged micro-regions. The scope of EU funding must be extended in the near future so that provision of quality public services can also become eligible. The rules of cofinancing should be revised and possibly differentiated so that projects targeting the Roma could possibly be required to be funded with a lower proportion of national cofinancing and a higher share from the EU. The idea of performance, that Parliament stood so firmly behind last year, should remain on the agenda. The fourth point that I would like to raise is also related to the European Parliament’s report last year, when we stated that the EU policy to improve the socio-economic status of the European Roma must not compromise, but complement, anti-discrimination legislation. Therefore, Directive 2000/43/EC on equal treatment must be finally implemented in the Member States and enforced by the Commission. The national equality bodies must be strengthened and all violations of these legal principles must be immediately reported and sanctioned."}

Many new ways to communicate, shop or access information online have appeared. ‘We need to ensure that European legislation evolves with them’. This is a quote from the Commission, and I can’t agree more. The question is, how will we legislate? I come from Estonia, a Member State that is known for digital lifestyle, and that has been offering thousands of online services for its citizens for more than a quarter of a century. I have experienced benefits and I know the challenges. The aim of the Digital Services Act is to create a safer digital space for the fundamental rights of users, and to ensure that the fundamental rights of users are protected, secure online services are provided, and a level playing field for businesses is established. I would like to congratulate my dear colleague Christel Schaldemose for her extraordinary job, and I would like to thank all the colleagues who contributed to this file. The text is balanced, the text is good, but it can be improved. In the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs we have focused in particular on issues related to digital privacy, targeted advertising and content moderation. We now have the possibility to take much-needed action in all three of these areas, and to put citizens’ rights at the centre of the framework. On targeted advertising, it is essential to have greater transparency. I would urge colleagues to support measures to ensure that there is clear consent for behavioural advertising, and that this does not involve sensitive personal data. Increasing the choice and transparency of recommender algorithms may seem obscure, but this is crucial to reduce disinformation and empower citizens’ control. When moderating content, we support stronger safeguards to ensure that upload filters do not become mandatory and that where automated tools are used, qualified staff decide on any action to be taken. To conclude, I hope that also in this file, the EU can show the light and global standards for regulating technology."}

The decision of the European Council to grant candidate status to Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova and to offer this perspective to Georgia, once it fulfils the conditions, was correct. This is a decision supported by the European Parliament and it corresponds to the expectations of the people in these countries. The people of Ukraine are defending European values with their lives in Ukraine and the people of Moldova have opened their houses to Ukrainian refugees. More Ukrainian refugees have entered the Republic of Moldova in relation to its population than any EU Member State. We, as the European Parliament, have understood early that we can only live in safety and security within the borders of the European Union if the countries in our immediate neighbourhood borders are safe and stable. This is why we called already in March for Ukraine, and in May for the Republic of Moldova, to work towards granting this candidate status. Because in these times we have to act quickly, clearly without hesitation. Dear colleagues, Members of the Parliament, thank you very much for the fact that Parliament stood united since the beginning of this war in supporting countries in our eastern neighbourhood. Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova still have a long way to go before they are ready for EU membership but, Vice-President Šefčovič, we have to make sure that we start this process at a technical level and we have to make sure that even before these countries are ready to join, we support them and we make sure that the people in these countries can start feeling the benefits of getting closer to the European Union. The Council made the right decisions on Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova, but the outcome on Western Balkans was disappointing. I was encouraged, President Michel, by your remarks today, and I believe we all have to work together so that we make sure that the Czech Presidency succeeds where the French Presidency has not managed to succeed, in offering a clear perspective to the Western Balkan countries. Good news came from the European Council when it comes to the euro area. Thank you, President Michel, for endorsing Croatia’s readiness to become a member of the euro area on 1 January. We have yesterday voted with a large majority here to approve Croatia’s entry into the euro area on 1 January. Every single member of the four largest groups in the European Parliament, and many colleagues in the other groups, have voted in favour. So thank you very much dear colleagues, this shows us that Croatia’s path on strengthening its economy, on managing its budget with care, on getting closer to the euro area under the leadership of Prime Minister Andrej Plenković, was correct. It pays off. It is good news for Croatia. It is good news for the euro area. It will make the euro area stronger and it shows the trust in our common currency. Last point, it is our duty, dear colleagues, to further strengthen the European Union. We have to equip the European Union with the tools it needs to overcome the problems that people are facing. We held the Conference on the Future of Europe but, President Michel, the outcome of the European Council saying that ‘we take note of this and we are happy that there was an exchange with citizens’ is too little. We have to take the ideas of the citizens on board. We have to solve their problems and we have to do this together. Council, Commission and Members of the European Parliament, we have to make the EU fit for the future. We have to make sure that it can make decisions, it can react fast, and it offers solutions to the problems that people are facing."}

A vital aim here is to soften the impact on regions hardest hit by new measures needed to combat climate change - especially islands. One very delicate matter for this report and a major point for the S&D is the internal governance of the Bank. There exists a dysfunctional relation between staff and management, with a negative impact on EIB output. Meanwhile, the EIB remains the only EU institution that does not recognise its employees’ right to join a trade union, contradicting the EU’s basic values and ILO recommendations.

Does the Council really believe that, in this current international context where human rights, democracy and the rule of law are facing roll-backs across different continents, this is what we should be doing?

What really concerns me is that the EU seems to be following in the footsteps of the USA, while China is out there and is offering easy money – with heavy penalties, though, strings attached!

Mr López Aguilar referred to the fact that in his opinion, as a lawyer, we are not responsible. I am not speaking as a lawyer, but as a politician. Millions of people in Europe are affected by this judgment by the judges in Strasbourg. This is why it is a good thing that we are discussing it here. The relationship between church and state in Europe has always been disputed and has led to bloody conflicts. It is right and proper that the European Union has managed to separate the state from religion. This is a good thing. However, we have a wide range of different models in Europe. France is clearly a non-religious state, while in Great Britain, the Head of State, the Queen, is also the head of the church. We have different models of how the relationship between church and state has developed. For this reason, I believe it is a good thing that we are calling for subsidiarity in this area and that every country can go its own way. I would even like to take things a step further. I do not want to talk about subsidiarity, but about the basic issue that, from my perspective, the European values of solidarity, subsidiarity and freedom are unthinkable without a foundation in Christianity and in the Judaeo-Christian understanding of religion. Why do we not find these values in China or in the Middle East? This is because they are based on our culture and our religions. It is possible to mention this without forcing anyone to accept the same faith. We are proud of our religious freedom. There is religious freedom in the sense that it is possible for me to decide to be an atheist. That is acceptable and legitimate and we have fought for this. However, there is also the right to have a faith. In my region, where more than one million people live, over 80% are Catholics. Just as atheists call for others to show them tolerance, so the Catholics who make up more than 80% of the population are calling for non-believers to be tolerant of their faith. They want to be able to show their faith in public, to represent it and to have Christian symbols accepted by the minority in this majority society. This is also legitimate in terms of religious freedom. Anyone who calls for tolerance must also show tolerance to those who practise a Christian faith."}

But sadly, the freedom of movement of rainbow families is not guaranteed. It is a time now that the Commission and the Council act to ensure the legal protection for rainbow families exercising their fundamental right to free movement, and that the Baby Sara judgment is implemented.

In my own Member State of Ireland, despite the legalisation of same—sex marriage in 2015, rainbow families still face a variety of struggles, especially concerning the legal parenthood of children. The choice of donors affects same sex parents’ legal relationship to their children. In particular, the system leaves gay men and our trans—community and others having children in legal limbo.

Every shepherd has to keep track of every sheep, but no EU institution knows precisely how many laws we have. We have laid down something like 20 000 rules filling more than 100 000 pages. The state of the law governing, for example, the fisheries area is to be sought in more than 70 different regulations. Why not combine all the rules governing the same subject in one simple act? In that way, citizens themselves will be able to see and read the resultant act, which is the first precondition for their having influence.

We shall also adopt the democratic principle from our own constitutions, namely that, in future, it will not be possible to adopt any EU law without its having been decided on here in the European Parliament. Under these arrangements, EU laws would be able to authorise the issue of notifications, but any such instrument could be reconsidered on the basis of a straightforward majority in the Council and Parliament. All committee procedures in which a minority combines with the Commission to legislate against the majority in the national parliaments and the European Parliament should also be abolished. It is absurd that the Commission should have been able to approve genetically modified cornflakes when, their citizens having discovered what had really been decided behind closed doors, 14 out of 15 countries were opposed to such approval and country number 15 also came out in opposition.

The upper limit of this level is an incidence of 100 cases per million adult cattle over the past 12 months. The BSE incidence in Spain has been increasing since the beginning of 2002. The incidence is, however, still well below this upper limit of around 45 cases per million adult cattle over the past 12 months, and it is not increasing rapidly. Therefore, the classification of Spain by the Scientific Steering Committee still remains valid. In the first quarter of this year, Spain reported about 50% more BSE cases than during the corresponding period last year. At the same time the number of cases decreased or was stable in all other Member States, except Portugal. Compared with other Member States, Spain has a rather high rate of young animals born in 1997 and 1998. The feeding of ruminant proteins to ruminants is considered to be the main source of BSE transmission to cattle. Therefore, the Commission imposed a Community-wide prohibition of the use of mammalian proteins in ruminant feed in 1994. It is, however, evident that this ban was not fully enforced at that time, since most of the BSE cases reported today were born after 1994. Meat-and-bone meal continued to be allowed in feed for non-ruminants, and thereby ruminant feed was contaminated in feed mills and during storage and transport. Another source of transmission was cross-feeding of feed intended for non-ruminants to cattle on mixed farms. Shortcomings in the implementation of the feed ban were observed throughout the Community. To put an end to the transmission of BSE the feed ban was extended to the use of all animal proteins in feed for all farmed animals at the beginning of 2001. Other measures to reduce the transmission of BSE are improved rendering standards – which came into effect in early 1997 – and a ban on the use of so-called BSE risk materials in food and feed, which became effective in October 2000. The current Community legislation should, if rigorously implemented, be sufficient to prevent new animals from becoming infected. BSE cases will, nevertheless, continue to appear in Spain, as in other Member States, for a number of years because of an incubation time of four to six years or even longer. That is why it is important to maintain current safeguards, in particular the removal of specified risk material."}

The current quality schemes are: Protected designation of origin (PDO), Protected Geographical Indication (PGI), Traditional Specialty Guaranteed (TSG), Organic Farming and Outermost Regions, all with their respective logos. They bring greater added value for farmers and consumers. I therefore welcome the rapporteur’s initiative, which urges the Commission to make these schemes easier to understand and to extend them to ‘products of island farming’."}

And I will not speak about Lukashenko today, but I will emphasis that, in this House, it’s quite popular to say that defence of the EU’s borders is in some way against the human rights of migrants. It’s wrong. Yes, we need to take care about the humanitarian crisis of those migrants who became hostages of the Lukashenko regime in Belarus. But we also need to take care of the safety of those hundreds of thousands of migrants, who potentially will be tempted to take the same route towards the EU if they see that the EU is not able to defend its borders. Those who now are criticising Poland or Lithuania should understand what kind of crisis can be created if the borders were not defended. Let’s find an effective humanitarian solution today, but let’s not create false hopes, which would lead to much bigger suffering, with much bigger numbers of potential victims."}

Europe’s ambition is to be digitally sovereign in an open and interconnected world. A digital future can be a human-centred, sustainable and more prosperous future. However, as we pursue digital policies that empower people and businesses to seize this future, we recognise that there is a real risk of a digital divide. The Commission therefore welcomes this report on the role of cohesion policy in promoting innovative and smart transformation and regional ICT connectivity. We agree on the challenges the report identifies. They are also addressed in our 2030 Digital Compass: the European way for the Digital Decade, the long-term vision for the European rural areas, as well as the recently published 8th Cohesion Report. Cohesion investments address the specific concerns raised in the Committee on Regional Development (REGI) report. Cohesion policy invests substantially in the digital agenda. EUR 18 billion were invested in information and communication technologies in the 2014-2020 period through the European Regional Development Fund. The 2021 programmes are gearing up for further investment in digitalisation. The cohesion policy post-2020 with its first policy objective – more competitive and smarter Europe – will promote innovative and smart economic transformation and regional ICT connectivity, including support to SMEs. Inclusive and fair digitalisation is central to the cohesion approach and answers the key points raised in your report. First, the goal of cohesion policy is to ensure that no one is left behind and that every European benefits. We are committed to tackling the digital divide. Inclusive and fair digitalisation is central to the overall approach to such investment. Cohesion policy invests in digital highways where they do not currently exist, and we support the provision of e-government services accessible to all citizens. This is also why, as part of the long-term vision for the European rural areas, we will address the digital infrastructure and skills gap through rural proofing, along with data collection by the Rural Observatory. Stakeholders and representatives at various levels around the Rural Pact will promote connected rural areas. Secondly, we have built in requirements for gender equality. This is a pre—condition, an enabling condition. We are checking all the new programmes against a number of very specific criteria before approval. Thirdly, we have a particular focus on the digitalisation of small and medium—sized enterprises, so we very much welcome your report’s focus on SMEs too. Last, and perhaps most importantly, we fully agree that digital technology has a key role to play in helping every region to find the formula for future success so that the green transition is fair and works for everyone. However, cohesion investments and the Digital Decade will work together to this end. The European ambition is to be digitally sovereign in an open and interconnected world and, as I said from the beginning, to pursue digital policies that empower people, and this includes addressing vulnerabilities and dependencies as well as accelerating investment. For example, in order to contribute to bridging the digital divide, the recent proposal for a satellite-based connectivity system has as one of its stated goals to remove dead zones, increasing cohesion across Member States’ territories, including rural, peripheral, remote and isolated areas and islands. We welcome this report. We will welcome its conclusions, and we look forward to further collaboration with the Parliament as we move to implementation."}

How can we, supposedly for the sake of protecting minors, undermine both freedom of expression and of information, and, above all, sanction discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation? We know very well that a text of this kind leads to concealing one’s sexual orientation and runs counter to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) rights which we have defended and which this Parliament has defended. Furthermore, at a time when we are witnessing acts of violence and aggression towards homosexuals, this is an incitement to criminalising homosexuality and a call for violence. We cannot give to young people an image of Europe as a society that is closed, intolerant, inward-looking and that disregards respect for other people. For us, therefore, this law is in complete contradiction with European values, as contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. As has been said, it also goes against the whole antidiscriminatory corpus of Union law, which has greatly contributed to making our national laws more egalitarian in many aspects of everyday life from employment to information or education. I thank you, Commissioner, for making a very clear statement, and I would like all groups to understand your argument as well as that of my fellow Members. I would like to call upon all fellow Members from all the political groups to join with the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament (S&D), the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), the Greens/European Free Alliance (Verts/ALE) and the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left (GUE/NGL), who have taken the initiative in drafting this resolution."}

It’s a typical example of such ostrich politics. Why? Because we know that we will do the enlargement to 35-36 Member States, but we are not ready as a European Union to receive these 35-36 countries in total. And what you do in this communication is saying, oh, the problems , we are going to solve them inside the European Union because we have the passerelle clause, which we didn’t apply for 20 years, and we have the enhanced cooperation as the way to solve the problems. Which is a devastating thing because we have already Schengen, we have already the Euro, we have already the patent, we have already the fiscal compact, we have already the arrest warrant. And we will add additional enhanced cooperation. That is what the communication is saying, that these are the two tools to solve the problems in a Union of 35-36 Member States. Well, I have to tell you, I find this irresponsible and insane. And moreover, it’s the first time, in my opinion, that I have seen that the Commission is renouncing its historical role to be at the side of the European Parliament, to bring forward the reform treaties that are absolutely necessary to make this union ready for 36 Member States. Why is there nothing about Treaty change in your communication? I will tell you why there is nothing, because Ms von der Leyen does not want that there is something on Treaty change. She need to be re-elected, presented by the Member States, by the Council so that you cannot. So I tell you one thing. I tell you one thing. In any case, my group will not vote in the next Parliament for a candidate for President of the European Commission and for a Commission that is not putting Treaty change as an essential condition for the enlargement of the European Union. That is clear. It’s very clear. And it’s a shame, I tell you that, that we asked the Commissioners to change that communication and to be aware of the need to change the Treaty. How will you do it? A Commission with 36 Members? You are already now with 27, have not enough competences to fulfil the different portfolios. Will you do it like that? Continue with unanimity? Continue with the budget with 1 %? The geopolitical Commission with the budget of 1 % of European GDP. It’s ridiculous to talk about the geopolitics. I find it insane that the Commission comes forward with a crucial communication on the future of the European Union, including preparing the enlargement to 36 Member States, and then says nothing, but, oh, we have the passerelle clause to solve our problems, something that has not been applied and cannot be applied in the Union because it needs a unanimous decision. So I tell you, and I repeat myself for the last time, this is my last intervention. So I will not bother you anymore in the coming years. Not inside the Parliament, but more, maybe outside the Parliament. Be sure of that. There will be no support for a new Commission after these elections if a treaty reform is not from day one on the table."}

In actual fact, it is only after that that this House will be able to speak out formally about the agreement, by means of a report, which I will then be drafting as soon as possible. With the resolution, though, which has been compiled on my initiative with the support of the various groups, we want to send a clear message to the Council and the Commission. In a nutshell, Commissioner, you can count on our support, and we are asking the Council to approve the negotiated agreement. This agreement constitutes a major breakthrough on the road towards a fully integrated transatlantic aviation market and offers a way of escaping the legal sword of Damocles that has for some time been hanging over the aviation sector. Opponents of the agreement are right when they say that there is still an imbalance between the rights which US companies can assert in Europe and the rights which we can assert in the USA. There are historical reasons for this, because the US, thanks to a combination of bilateral agreements, is capable of a great deal more than us. We should not overlook the fact, though, that the European aviation market was not liberalised in one step or overnight. We were clearly in favour of one big agreement, but we think that this is not feasible politically speaking. For European consumers, this agreement is good news. As you stated before, European companies will be able to fly from anywhere in Europe to anywhere in the United States, which will lead to a greater supply and probably a reduction in prices. Moreover, the US has made a number of concessions to grant European companies a little more access to the domestic US market. You gave a few examples a moment ago. What matters to us, though, is that this should be followed up by a second step. We also think that if we set up a joint committee, this will allow a permanent dialogue, in which a host of aspects with regard to the social dimension, the environment, safety and security, can be addressed. We placed quite a bit of emphasis on this aspect in the resolution, because to us, the liberalisation of the aviation sector, with all its implications, both positive and negative, must coincide with the laying down of high standards in the areas I have just listed. We have noted, for example, that technical cooperation is provided for in the area of the environment so that the most efficient flight routes can be used in future. This is a good thing. To the doubting Thomases, particularly our British fellow Members, who are under pressure, I should like to say that in my view, they too stand to benefit a great deal from the agreement. More than ever, Heathrow airport will be able to develop into the gateway to America, with more direct connections near British consumers. Finally, Commissioner, we, for our part, will do our best to bring the subsequent stages to a successful end, by, for example, establishing contact with our counterparts from the Congress. We hope we can count on your continued involvement in future negotiations."}

We must also strengthen economic growth and improve our long-term competitiveness; have a new ambitious industrial strategy building on and complementing the circular economy package; respond to climate change and ensure energy security. The EU must also give a consistent response to the increased inflow of refugees; organise direct resettlement and relocation of asylum seekers and ensure their safety and humane treatment.

And I read this morning that container shipping companies made profits of almost USD 50 billion in the third quarter alone of this year, and that kind of money surpasses the profits of tech giants like Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, despite the fact that most of the underlying costs for these companies haven’t changed. And these spiralling costs of shipping, up almost a thousand per cent for some routes from China to Europe, these are disrupting supply chains and they are increasing costs for consumers. And the impact of these increases, it tends to impact most on the less well-off and smaller countries. And, of course Covid and the Suez Canal blockage played a role, but we also know that there are competition concerns in the shipping centre. And when can we expect some action from the Commission on concentration in the market? I do find it interesting that we constantly hear from the shipping industry and from some MEPs that tackling the climate crisis will negatively impact EU shipping’s competitiveness or be too expensive. And this argument is at the core of the opposition to even mild attempts to decarbonise the sector. Of course, such a short-sighted view conveniently ignores the fact that competitiveness is irrelevant if parts of the Earth are uninhabitable. So my question to the shipping companies is, will you be investing the tens of billions of euro of profit into truly clean technologies to save us from the climate emergency? And another crucial and related issue is that some of our trade flows are inherently unsustainable, sending apples from New Zealand to Ireland is surely unsustainable and we need to tackle all of this. So the true cost of some things in our economy is rarely reflected, and this is particularly true in the field of transport. If we’re serious about the price of carbon, we must take action. We must tackle the shipping sector and ensure that the decarbonise."}

Nevertheless, the Member States are free to apply these Directives in the manner they consider most appropriate to satisfying national conditions and needs, and also to establish stricter minimum rules provided that they conform to Community rules and, in particular, the principles of the Treaty. In other words, we are leaving a margin for subsidiarity in order to adapt and apply the Directives in the most appropriate way in line with the reality and diversity of the various Member States. The Commission considers it essential to guarantee a common level of true openness of the electricity markets of the various States and under equal conditions. Within this context, following the adoption of Directive 96/92/EC, that is, the first Directive on electricity, the Commission published an annual comparative evaluation report in which it examined the application of the internal market in gas and electricity in all the States of the Union. These reports demonstrated a significant difference between the true levels of openness of the market. This led the Commission to propose a second package of legislative measures to complete the internal market in electricity and to prevent the tensions and distortions which were arising and these measures include Directive 2003/54/EC and Regulation 1228/2003, which Parliament and the Council adopted last June and which will enter into force in July 2004. The new legislation lays down common minimum rules on market openness which are much higher both in quantitative terms, that is to say, the minimum level of openness of the market, and in qualitative terms: legal separation, regulated access for third countries etc. With regard to the quantitative measures, two stages are proposed: a first stage, July 2004, when the consumer market other than homes has to be opened up to competition, and in July 2007, 100% of the market. In any event, this will result in a reduction of the current asymmetries between the various European Union markets, and will make it possible to achieve what has been the aim since the first Directive: to integrate the European area into a single electricity and gas market, doing away with the borders that remain today and preventing something we do not want: 15 markets, or 25 markets from 1 May, in electricity and gas. This is not our aim. Our aim is to create a European market, an integrated single market in electricity and gas."}

According to an Oxford study prepared for the Commission, in the next 25 years, 30% –almost one third – of today’s jobs in Europe will disappear. They simply will not exist anymore. Janitors, taxi drivers, postmen and low—skilled workers will be replaced by cleaning-machine operators or robot station managers. This will happen pretty soon, during the lifetime of MEPs, even taking into account that our average age is 55. When we retire we can allow ourselves to observe changes from the sidelines, but our children and grandchildren will find themselves at the epicentre of this evolution. Their level of digital skills will determine not only the welfare of our descendants but also the future of our common project, a united Europe. While working on this report, representatives of all the political groups agreed that having or not having digital skills will become the basis of a new social divide in the near future. On the other hand, a high level of digital education will open new opportunities for economic growth. It’s a challenge for which – let’s face it – our education system is not ready. At a time when there is nothing to do on the labour market without a knowledge of programming languages, we are discussing how many more schools in remote areas will receive an internet connection this year. Everyone knows that, after graduation, each student must have a certain level of knowledge in mathematics, languages or biology, but we do not have a universal mandatory system for evaluating digital skills. Moreover, in Europe there is no set of professional requirements for an information technology teacher – and the extent to which teachers use technology in class differs across EU Member States like day from night. This report therefore calls on the Commission, at least in its next term of office, to develop an EU—wide strategy for education in digital skills. Our current approach consists of loose projects from various departments, which are all on a voluntary basis. It is important to set common goals for all Member States to reach a certain level of digital skills. If no goals are set, there is little motivation to invest. It is important that digital skills are assessed so that a proper comparison can be made. Therefore, the report calls for the creation of an assessment based, for example, on a Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) model. Of course, teachers have to be at the core of this development and they need to be properly trained and assisted. As teachers are already under increasing work pressure, this should not entail extra workload. Finally, the approach should be based on lifelong learning. Technological development will not stop, and we will have to adapt throughout our lives to new changes. We need to be able to recognise them and to learn how to learn. Those unable to adapt will be left behind. This is not only about the labour market: technology has become a part of our daily lives. Banking, doing taxes and even health care are becoming more digital. In addition, our social and political lives now develop online. Devices have entirely changed not only the way we communicate but also the way we consume information and form our opinions. This all requires skills: media literacy, etiquette online, cyber hygiene and protection of personal information. Those who do not know how to use online communications in a proper way will either be easily manipulated or simply left out of political participation. It is crucial to ensure that everyone profits from technological development, and education is the best way to start."}

Of course, the context today in Europe is uncertain. In addition to the one war that we have been facing in Ukraine for more than one and a half years now, we saw the terrorist attacks of Hamas against Israel that have to unite us, that have to be condemned with all toughness, and which for sure will require us to do more in the area of security, defence, migration. We will have to do more than planned. We will have to do it earlier, and we will have to do it for a longer period of time. Inflation, energy crisis, the situation in Armenia, the migration challenge and of course the food tensions; our agenda remains busy. Nevertheless, I believe that the approach that you have presented now to focus on delivering, on providing concrete solutions which work in reality to the people of Europe, is correct – not to come up with new initiatives which we cannot conclude, which we cannot solve before the European elections, but to deliver on what we have promised. In that sense, we count on the Commission respecting the democratic calendar. We are looking forward to working with you over the course of the first four months of next year before the European elections, focusing on the top priorities and on making sure that we can still conclude and we can still deliver on some files. What do we expect as the EPP Group? Firstly, I would like to welcome the approach that you have put forward on reducing bureaucracy, reducing red tape, supporting small and medium-sized enterprises and supporting competitiveness only through strengthening our economy, making it more competitive, research-oriented, more innovative can we secure the high social standards that we have here in Europe. So this competitiveness agenda is not something abstract, but it is something that profoundly benefits enterprises and people in Europe. We have to work together on this. We have to make sure that whenever the Commission puts legislation forward, it does not negatively affect the competitiveness of our economy. We should implement what we have all together agreed in the Conference on the Future of Europe: the competitiveness check – the European Commission should please control that whenever it wants to put legislation forward it does not negatively affect competitiveness. Likewise, we also expect the Draghi report on competitiveness to be concluded before June 2024. And we expect the appointment of an SME envoy to take place. This SME envoy should be equipped with proper staff, with proper competences, responsibilities, and powers to also safeguard for good SME policy. For our group, of course, trade policy is important. Only an economy that is open, that trades with other parts of the world, is a strong economy. Please make progress and bring towards the ratification of Parliament the agreement with Chile, already finalised, with Australia, which good progress is being made on, and we need to make progress on Mexico as well. Last point, of course, Executive Vice-President, one of the key tools that the European Union has to deliver on its agenda is the budget. Please work with us to put pressure on the Presidency of the Council, and especially on the European Council President, to deliver this revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework, which would allow us to better protect our borders, to support refugees when they come to tackle the migration crisis, to do more on security, defence and to help Ukraine in a predictable manner, and from our side also the action plan on cyber bullying. Cyber bullying is bullying. This needs to be addressed as well. Thank you very much and we are looking forward to working with the Commission for the first part of next year."}

The scope of the rule of law mechanism is broader than the cooperation and verification mechanism (CVM) and it covers not only judicial reform and the fight against corruption, but also – as we have discussed just before – freedom and privileges, as well as institutional checks and balances. The rule of law report was just adopted last week and, as I explained in my presentation to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) last week or around then, the report on the country chapters developed for each Member State cover the rule of law situation in all of them, including Bulgaria. More particularly, as regards Bulgaria, let me underline some of the most significant developments taken into account in the report. As regards judicial independence, Bulgaria still needs to finalise, taking account of the opinion of the Venice Commission, legal procedures concerning the effective accountability and criminal liability of the Prosecutor—General. In addition, the composition and functioning of the Supreme Judicial Council has been subject of further debate. On a more positive tone, controversial provisions relating to the automatic suspensions of magistrates in case of a criminal investigation and to the obligation for magistrates to declare their membership in professional organisations have been repealed. However, and it also confirms past CVM findings, despite a comprehensive reform of its legal and institutional anti-corruption framework and improved cooperation between the authorities, there is still the need to establish a solid track record of final convictions in high-level corruption cases. It is important that the authorities are provided with sufficient resources in order to be able to fight corruption effectively. The necessary strictures are essentially in place, but Bulgaria has to make them deliver reserves more efficiently. Lack of reserves in the fight against corruption is one of the key aspects raised throughout the ongoing process. Perception surveys show a very low level of public trust in the anti-corruption institutions. It is important to show that there is political will to fight corruption in a credible manner. As to media privilege, the legal framework is in place, but safeguards are often not effectively implemented in practice. In addition, lack of transparency of media ownership is considered a source of concern. Finally, the issues concerning checks and balances include concerns about the limited use of public consultations and impact assessments in the legislative process. Furthermore, the already narrow civic space in Bulgaria could be further affected in view of a new draft law on foreign funding for NGOs. To conclude, let me reiterate once more that the Commission is determined to continue to use all the instruments at its disposal to address the concerns identified in the country. I am convinced that it is important to look at all the Member States in a fully objective and comparable manner. This is what we are now doing with the new rule of law report, and the Commission appreciates the continued support of the European Parliament in this respect. Of course, we have been working for some years about the CVM, but we continue, also, to work with the annual report of the rule of law with a broader scope on all the Member States, including Bulgaria."}

Some 60 000 migrants arrived, many of them needing protection. Numbers so far this year are much lower: 790 people were intercepted in the first three months of the year. We all hope the situation in North Africa will continue to stabilise, but people are still likely to try to cross the Mediterranean. Large influxes remain possible, and Europe needs to be ready to react. That, by the way, is not just an Italian issue; it is a matter of concern to the whole of Europe. The EU acted quickly last year to support Italy, notably through the Hermes and Aeneas border surveillance operations coordinated by Frontex. Frontex stands ready to support Italy this year too. Those operations both intercept irregular migrants and rescue those in distress. Preventing tragedies at sea is a key objective. The Eurosur system we proposed last year should also help by improving detection and tracking of small boats, which should enable faster rescue missions. Some of those arriving are fleeing persecution and violence and need international protection. EU asylum rules aim to ensure that those who need it have effective access to asylum procedures, even when they are part of mixed migration flows. The Commission closely monitors the implementation of those rules. The closure of Lampedusa as a safe port of disembarkation is a matter of concern, something we quickly communicated to the Italian authorities. Commissioner Malmström was in Rome two weeks ago, and she was pleased to hear that Italy intends to renovate the damaged facilities so that Lampedusa can again become a point of first reception, assistance and initial screening before migrants are transferred to centres elsewhere in Italy, where their possible needs for protection can be assessed. The Commission looks forward to hearing the date for the reopening, and that reopening is part of a wider proposal which the new Italian Government has run up for an integrated strategy on management of the EU southern border. This proposal is very welcome, and we look forward to seeing how it is taken forward. The Reception Conditions Directive obliges the Member States to provide asylum seekers with appropriate accommodation. The Member States have some flexibility in how this is provided, and specifically designated reception centres are one option. The Commission is in close contact with the Italian authorities with a view to ensuring appropriate conditions and will not hesitate to take appropriate action. When it comes to the detention of irregular migrants, the Return Directive includes important safeguards, notably, that the detainees must be kept in specialised facilities and must always be separated from ordinary prisoners. Families must be given separate accommodation, and children need access to education. The NGOs should be able to visit, and the detainees need to be able to contact their families and legal representatives. Both asylum seekers and those subject to a return procedure must have access at least to essential health care. Italy notified the Commission of its transposition of the Return Directive last year. We are currently checking that this was done in line with the directive. As far as the guarantees I just mentioned are concerned, initial findings are that Italy has correctly transposed them. To help address those challenges, Italy has received substantial financial support from the EU, with a total of EUR 232 million allocated for 2010, making it one of the largest beneficiaries of the ‘Solidarity and management of migration flows’ general programme. This is before you count emergency financial support, which was over 18 million last year – and part of that was used to expand and develop government reception centres. The EU is also developing deeper contacts on migration and mobility issues with the southern Mediterranean countries where possible, notably including Tunisia and Libya."}

The United Kingdom wants to have wealthy and successful neighbours. The best outcome for us is that the remaining EU should have free trade agreements with friends and allies on every continent. If it had been more willing to take that approach over the 40 years of our membership, I suspect we would not have got to where we are now."}

This is the most important reform in almost two decades. It is a long overdue reform, because in the last 20 years, many things have changed. The world has changed. So we need to adjust. From the very start, our objective for this package was clear: to ensure timely and equal access to medicines for all Europeans, regardless of where they live in the Union, whilst at the same time fostering innovation and competitiveness for our industry. Contrary to certain arguments that these objectives are antagonistic or do not combine, I want to take this opportunity today to say that we think that they are both compatible and perfectly feasible. We can respond, with this reform, both to the needs of the patient and the expectations of the market. Indeed, our pharmaceutical sector, our pharmaceutical industry is a European champion. The EU is the second largest market in the world for pharmaceuticals, and pharma represents the biggest single contributor to our trade surplus. So having a robust regulatory environment matters. It matters a lot. Coming now to patients, we also have inequality and difficulties there. Patients in bigger and wealthier Member States get their medicines first and faster whilst, at the same time, waiting time for patients to have access to new medicines varies from a few months to up to two years across the EU. This has to change, and it is precisely these objectives are what are driving our reform. These two arguments are two sides of the same coin. We are reforming legislation having in mind three main priorities: first, wider access to medicines through incentives to reward innovation and supply; number two, cheaper medicines through earlier availability of generics and biosimilars; and number three, faster rules, faster procedures, simplification so that the EU and its industry will remain globally competitive. This is not a theory. This is something that will bring concrete, tangible change on the ground. New medicines will reach 70 million more patients in the EU, especially in areas where treatments are lacking, like rare diseases and paediatric cancers. For the industry, this would entail savings between EUR 500 million to EUR 1 billion over the next 15 years. This is a win win situation. Honourable Members, I would like to commend this House, the rapporteurs, the shadows, all those involved, because you gave this file all the priority it deserves, and you delivered so quickly. The main elements of what we proposed have been retained, in particular the set-up of an incentive system that is modulated and geared towards results. Other elements of our proposals have been further developed, like the notions of regulatory sandboxes or incentives for priority antimicrobials, and new ideas have been introduced on joint procurement, on Hera, for example. Some of these proposals raise questions about effectiveness, visibility, red tape, sustainability of health systems. Still, all your thoughts and ideas form a basis for sound interinstitutional discussions. In the Council, Member States have not yet developed a mandate, so the Commission will reserve our position, but we are sure that we can look forward to the next steps and hold honest negotiations based on facts. By the end of this month, we will launch a coalition to address a collateral but yet connected and burning issue – the one on how to avoid shortages of the most pressing medicines. This will take the form of a Critical Medicines Alliance, under which we will mobilise all stakeholders for the benefit of society. In concluding, let me reiterate that we are now facing a great opportunity to create a single market for medicines and one that is fair, future-proofed and globally competitive. Let’s seize this moment. Let’s take this opportunity. This is what Europe knows best – smart, proportionate and effective regulation."}
{"id": "90dccd8c-dd78-4f30-af5f-2cc4eba11495", "text": "Madam President, first of all, honourable Members, I think this debate has shown the vital importance of the European Health Data Space as a pillar of the strong European Health Union that we all have been building and advocating. It’s by no coincidence. Again, I express my thanks to the two parliamentary committees that have worked jointly on this proposal that brings together two hugely important topics: that of health and that of our privacy. I fully agree that health data could not be more sensitive. Our General Data Protection Regulation fully recognises this, and what I can assure you is that we will never lose sight of it. I also share the Parliament’s view that for this to be able to be really an important part of the health union, it has to have the full trust of the patients and citizens. Let me use some of the words that you have used in in this debate. You have spoken of this being a massive opportunity. You have spoken of patients and citizens needing to have control over their own data. You have spoken of the importance of interoperability. Sara Cerdas spoke of the importance as a major step in the European Health Union. I noted as well many of the comments. There was also a comment here from, I think it was MEP Metz, on giving hope to those patients with rare diseases. This, I think, is important. These are our concepts, our principles that are close to all our hearts. But because there is a possibility that citizens and patients are following this debate today, I want to address two issues. First of all, on the issue to do with primary use, because a great deal has been heard. On primary use, the citizen has full control of what data is shared. So they have the possibility to restrict the visibility of parts of their data, including to certain categories, for example, of health professionals. So you are able to indicate the health data access service if you don’t want your health data to be accessible via the health professional access service. You can do this either on a general basis for all of your data, or you can do it for part of your data. For example, I don’t want my new GP to know that I had a treatment for a mental health issue several years ago. That is provided in the proposal. Because there was a lot of discussion on opt-out and opt-in for secondary use, I want to take just half a minute and just really emphasise why we have taken this in the proposal as a Commission. We believe that opt-out would seriously hamper the usefulness of the European Health Data Space for researchers and innovators because, in order for secondary use to be important, as I said at the beginning, it needs to be representative. If there are relevant differences between those who choose to opt out and those who do not, this could affect the bias of research results, especially for minority groups. I trust that this will be a discussion that will be held tomorrow. For us, it’s important that we get the details right. Of course, it’s important that we have data protection and fully respect fundamental rights of citizens and of patients. But ultimately, I believe that together with this House, we can work together in building a strong European Health Data Space, a strong European Health Union. We need to be ambitious, and I very much look forward to the trilogue starting as soon as possible and being able to deliver jointly within this Parliament’s mandate. Once again, thank you for the very close collaboration. Thank you for the debate today and I look forward to the discussion tomorrow."}

It is clear that Ukraine has been moving in the opposite direction over the last two years. Counterfeit goods have been produced, the judicial system has been politicised and there have been political trials. The leaders of the opposition are in prison as a result of politically motivated judgments. Mr Füle, I agree with you that this is a systemic issue. The problem is rooted in the system and it cannot be eliminated simply by introducing formal reforms. There must also be the determination and the readiness to apply them, to put the rule of law and democracy into practice and to take the consequences. This could be done now. We have been discussing the case of Yulia Tymoshenko, Yuri Lutsenko and many others for almost a year. New promises are constantly made and new procedures are initiated, but the promises are not kept and none of the measures are properly implemented. Instead, one gets the impression that the government is playing for time. Postponing the session of the court of appeal also seems to me to be a case of gaining time which will ultimately make it possible to prevent opposition politicians from taking part in the next elections. That is the crucial point. There can only be free and fair elections if the leaders of the opposition can participate in them on equal terms. The judicial system must not be used to stop this from happening. When matters are resolved in the court of appeal and then new cases are brought, which are actually old cases that the supreme court has ruled on several times in order to settle issues which have to do with the statute of limitations, that also represents an abuse of the rule of law. For this reason, Mr Füle, I believe that you are right. Because of the importance of Ukraine being a part of Europe, we are in favour of the association agreement. The European Parliament would be prepared to ratify the agreement very quickly and to support it being signed, if Ukraine fulfilled certain requirements. By initialling the agreement, we have shown that we are willing to do this. Now the ball is in the Ukrainian Government’s court. I hope that the government does not believe that the Commission, the Council and Parliament will get tired if it waits long enough and that, as a result, it will get something which it would not have achieved if it did not meet the requirement of introducing the rule of law."}

Because every day, women in Europe are murdered because of the violence that they suffer from their partner. Every week, more than 50 women are murdered in their own homes. Every third woman and girl in the EU has experienced physical or sexual violence, and 85% of all violent and sexual crimes are never reported to the police. This is 2023, and it is still happening. After almost ten years of pushing from the European Parliament from this House, now the ratification of the Istanbul Convention will finally raise the standard in combating and preventing gender—based violence across Europe. This means that we will be better in coordinating the necessary measures in the EU. We will be better in collecting data on how the situation is in every Member State. We will strengthen the judicial cooperation, share the best practices between countries and the EU will have a new role in monitoring how well the convention is being implemented. This is big. At the same time, in this historic decision, we are sending a clear political message that Europe has zero tolerance on violence against women. It is needed because women’s rights are restricted around the world and the oppression and the violence have increased. I also have another message. I want to send my strongest call to those remaining Member States, those six remaining Member States in the EU, to also individually ratify the Istanbul Convention. It is time for you to stand on the right side of history and to support women’s rights to life free from violence. Because fighting violence against women is about standing up for women’s freedom. It is about defending the fundamental rights and equality in Europe. This is what Europe is about. This is what this House is about, that we are a union of freedom, so let’s defend it all the way."}

This framework, once in place, will allow for the free movement of our citizens to gradually resume under safe conditions. It will allow for a consistent European approach to what you have always advocated in this House: a European solution to a European problem. Yesterday’s debate on this proposal showed that we share a common ambition. We need to have this framework fully in place in June. We owe this to our Union, to the citizens, to the businesses who have been asking for a safe return to normality. As you know, this is essential to put Europe back on its feet and our economies out of this crisis and to allow people to look forward to travelling in summer. For this to be possible it is important that interinstitutional negotiations start straight away. It is with this concern in mind that the Commission has requested the Parliament to activate the urgent procedure. During yesterday’s debate, we heard some concerns by Members of this House on the use of this procedure. These concerns stem from the fact that with this procedure there will be no vote on a report in the competent parliamentary committee. Yet the whole Parliament will be able to scrutinise the proposal within a time-frame of about a month and adopt its position in plenary before engaging in negotiations with the Council. Exceptional times call for exceptional measures and while we are called to work fast, it is important that the role of each institution is respected and that democratic scrutiny fully takes place. Citizens are looking at us for responses, for solutions, for fast decisions. So, moving forward, let us confirm that the Commission stands ready to provide its full support. We will act as an honest broker during the interinstitutional negotiations. In parallel we will support Member States in developing the necessary technical infrastructure."}
{"id": "4dc9567b-cdc4-4372-b252-a0bc30d25966", "text": "Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as far as the current state of affairs in the Community is concerned, no measures have yet been adopted at a Community level to eliminate double taxation in the area of direct taxation except for Council Directive 90/435/EEC of 23 July 1990 on the common system of taxation applicable in the case of parent companies and subsidiaries of different Member States, the convention of 23 July 1990 on the elimination of double taxation in connection with the adjustment of profits of associated enterprises and Council Directive 2003/48/EC of 3 June 2003 on taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments. This arises from the fact that the area in question falls within the responsibility of Member States, provided that they respect Community law. Agreements on eliminating double taxation which are concluded bilaterally between Member States in accordance with the aforementioned autonomous powers and consistent with the OECD sample agreement do not appear to be sufficient for eliminating all legal double taxation in the EU. The Commission, which has the exclusive right to initiate laws in the Community in relation to direct taxation, at present clearly prefers a pragmatic approach to this matter in view of the principle of subsidiarity that applies to Community legislation in the area of direct taxation and in view of the requirement for unanimity. This pragmatic approach should encourage Member States to cooperate in ensuring that their domestic taxation systems, including bilateral agreements on taxation, are functioning smoothly. This is mentioned, among other things, in the Commission communication on coordinating Member States’ direct tax systems in the internal market, especially in the final version of document COM 2006/823. The Council confirmed this coordination-based approach of the Commission in its conclusions of 27 March 2007. It emphasised that the functioning of the internal market can be improved through cooperation in the area of taxation at a Member State level and, where appropriate, at a European level, while respecting Member State powers at the same time. The Council declared that acceptable solutions could take various forms, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity."}

I must say that I was appalled at how the ticket allocation was handled by the French authorities. I know that a large number of people in Britain were equally frustrated. The release of the tickets was really too late for most people to be able to take up those opportunities given their work commitments. What we need, I believe, is some joined-up thinking. One of the main objectives of the EU institutions is to ensure that citizens of all EU countries are treated fairly and equally. In this instance, millions of football fans were discriminated against. And yet, this breach is taken lightly. Whatever the reasons for that particular measly fine, it will alienate a large number of fans. It is another missed opportunity to connect with the people of Europe. Football is a passion that unites all the countries. What better way for us to change our image and connect with the people of Europe than to say that we take football as seriously as we take any branch of commerce."}

It wants European industry to thrive in Europe. Any plan for Europe’s green and digital transition will only work if European industry is an integral part of the plan. We welcome the Commission’s updated strategy, but we still believe it’s a work in progress. We strongly support the idea of this ecosystem approach. These one-fits-all strategies of the past of industrial policy have been the reason why they have never been taken up neither by the industry nor by Member States, and we do believe that the update presents a part of that analysis. It covers six out of the 14 sectors, but that shows it’s still a work in progress and most of these ecosystems are not completed in definition or in description; analysis alone is not enough, so what we want is for each ecosystem to have an integrated strategy setting priorities for the Union in terms of funding policies and regulation and we do not want to have a planned economy, but we want that the instruments fit together. It needs to address the specific needs for competitiveness, sustainability and digitalisation of each ecosystem. It needs a reference frame to test the systems for each ecosystem. This ‘one-fits-all’ approach doesn’t work. Taxonomy shows us that’s not a wrong instrument, but does it work for each sector? Our industry needs this perspective now. The real implementation of the Union strategy starts soon, in just one year. By that time 2030 is only eight-and-a-half years away. That is an extremely short time for an industrial transition. To say it loud and clear: at present we have 120 instruments, agenda-setting instruments, funding instruments, regulation instruments, trade instruments, and so far we need this final cornerstone of the strategy to reflect better and that works in the individual sectors. So in the end, if that doesn’t fit together we don’t have high hopes that climate change and the digitalisation of work is going to work."}

In spite of all this, I would say, of course, there is still a lot that needs to be done. There are still barriers for persons with disabilities which block them from participating fully in society as we have heard, the reality of poverty, the reality of employment, there is so much which still needs to be done.

That is the case irrespective of which party someone belongs to, and it is not dependent on what branch of industry you talk to, either. So we have broad agreement. I would also like to thank my fellow Members who have indicated their agreement with this result this evening. I would like to mention three more aspects. As I said at the beginning of the debate, we will set the wheels in motion tomorrow. However, we will have to look very closely at whether the relaxations that we have introduced for micro-businesses, for agricultural undertakings, for example, and for artisan companies, are actually sufficient to enable these enterprises to obtain the money they are owed. We will have to examine very carefully how the limited freedom of contract will work. That is something new in the European internal market that we are now going to try out and that all of us also more or less support. We will need to examine whether the 8% late payment interest rate is adequate; Parliament would have liked it to be 9%. We will see how it works, and I would like to ask the Commission to pay close attention in order to ensure that, during the process of implementation, the Member States do not water down the directive. I also see definite success on the horizon. I have heard that Spain has already produced new national legislation following our methods, and I know that the same is true of other Member States. In any case, our Committee will monitor the situation or carry out an impact assessment according to a directive, so that the Member States also know that, when the parliamentary term comes to an end, we will know who has implemented the improved payment practices as we intended and who has not. I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to this result, including the Belgian Presidency, which has perhaps not received enough recognition for its contribution. We know how efficiently and constructively you conducted the negotiations – a small country, but I would say a country with very intelligent and efficient methods for achieving results in Europe."}

I would definitely like to call on you, Mrs Fischer Boel, to reiterate what you have done. It seems to me that the list of initiatives coming from the Commission is a long one, in fact it is almost too long. It is almost as if we are destroying the progress that we made in connection with the health check. I would also like to point out that the efforts that have been made thus far on behalf of the dairy farmers have clearly not been mirrored in relation to those workers in the car industry who have lost their jobs or those workers in the shipbuilding industry who have lost their jobs as a result of the current economic crisis. So I can only ask that we take a little care about how we handle this crisis and that we also make sure that we do not destroy the sound progress that was made, despite everything, as a result of the health check. The idea of freezing the milk quotas is, I think, completely hopeless! Nor can we go back to the old models by granting export refunds – that simply ruins the market for someone elsewhere in the world. We have to be careful. Commissioner, I would nonetheless like to ask you to reiterate the long list of activities that you have already undertaken so that my fellow Members can see that there is certainly no need for us to go crazy and start enacting numerous additional measures with the result that we destroy the sound progress that has been made."}

But it was almost one year ago, and it took us one year of negotiation to achieve an agreement. First in the Parliament, what was not easy, then with the Council and the Slovenian Presidency. But I would like to thank my colleagues, shadow rapporteurs for their hard work, involvement in the process until the last all—night trilogue in December. It was very, I think, very productive and very interesting. We had a different position, but we find agreement. And secondly, I have appreciated the pragmatic and efficient approach of the Slovenian Presidency. Thank you, Madam Ambassador Tamara Weingerl—Požar, you contributed very much to this agreement. And last but not least, I have to thank Commissioner Simson and your teams of Commissioner Simson for availability of advice and all expertise. I wanted to say that it is the first revision of TEN—E policy and PCI guidelines since its creation in 2013. And we have made a number of substantive changes in the regulation – I just mentioned the main. First of all, the governance process has been strengthened with a better stakeholder involvement. We discussed this very intensely about governance but it was changed. The second, the most important change is the mandatory sustainability criteria that have been introduced for all types of project. We have also extended the scope of the regulation in order to include some projects with third countries. These projects of mutual interest would have to demonstrate that they bring benefits for the Union and not for a single Member State. New categories of projects include hydrogen infrastructures, certain types of electrolysers, as well as smart gas grids to integrate low-carbon gases into existing gas network. Concerning the electricity, there are two major changes. The eligibility criteria for smart electricity grids have been simplified to enable more projects of common interest in that field. And we have introduced an amendment allowing new sub-category of projects to apply for PCI status and financing in the regions with low levels of offshore renewable electricity. The projects will consist of direct connections of the offshore wind farms to the national power systems in so-called radial form. This is an important addition for Member States and sea basins where offshore wind farms are at the planning stage. The final text of the revised regulation is a result of bargaining based on the Commission’s proposal, which, as you know, excluded from the start – and this is, I think, very important – further support for gas infrastructure in the framework of projects of common interest. And here I must say, in my draft report, published in March last year, I warned that the Commission may be over-optimistic in estimations of the level of connectivity and supply resilience for these natural gas networks, and that probably there are not yet enough interconnections in a lot of the smaller gas markets, for example in south—east Europe, and connectivity still poses a problem between some Member States and the rest of Europe. In the draft report adopted by the ITRE Committee we have included a definition of ‘security of supply’, meaning also ‘energy security’, and we have stated that it cannot be achieved without reducing strategic energy dependencies, it was very important. And we know that in the tragic reality of war in Europe and the dramatically low level of the Union’s energy security proves that, since years, the EU has made serious mistakes in assessing the needs, including in terms of trans-European energy infrastructure. And I think that the Commission now seems to recognise it and it’s probably too late to reopen the TEN—E Regulation but we understand that the Commission is already preparing an instrument to foster gas-network interconnection and LNG terminals in a desperate attempt to reduce the Union’s dependence on Russian imports."}

I call upon the Commission and Member States to recommit fully to the goals of the European Environment and Health Action Plan and furthermore to step up the plan by making it more ambitious and more in tune with our needs. I welcome, in particular, that which Commissioner Dimas had to say. The rise in the incidents of certain types of cancer shows us that we cannot afford to rest on our laurels. In particular, I want to single out action in the field of mental health as being of the utmost importance. Mental ill-health is a major risk factor for suicide in Ireland and suicide itself is the biggest killer of our young people. The EU should give more support to developing adequate prevention strategies, any actions at an EU or international level to help us promote mental health would be welcomed warmly. I also support the calls for action on the issue of indoor air quality and on the safety of chemical compounds used in equipment and furnishings. The Commission has taken some important action but we need a comprehensive policy on indoor air quality given the extent of respitory illness in the EU. We must also provide support for our SME's to ensure that they can comply with environmental health regulations and to take steps to improve the impact they have on the environment. In my constituency a wonderful project in relation to this subject was supported by Interreg. Our climate is changing and this brings with it new challenges in both the fields of health and environment. The new threats to our environment and our health caused by climate change must be met head-on and in an effective way.

We are witnessing a growing number of attacks against human rights defenders, as well as a reduced space for civil society organisations. Many governments have introduced repressive laws to curtail basic freedoms for citizens. In front of an increasingly challenging international context, the EU stands as the leading human rights actor. The first review of the EU action plan has shown positive results in mainstreaming human rights in our external action. The next step is to make sure that each international agreement includes a human rights clause so that companies based in third countries, as well as in Europe, comply with international standards. In this regard, the EU has a responsibility to act and be a global leader. We cannot let non—democracies take the lead and impose their anti—rights agenda.

First, the commercial decisions taken by companies at this time amid car industry woes across the European Union, across the world, may be something which car companies can put up with, but not the people working in them. We understand of course that there is overcapacity, maybe, but promises made are not promises to be broken easily either. I represent the area of Southampton Swaythling plant, which is the assembly for the Ford Transit Van which is now to be scrapped. This will have a major impact upon that community. I also have to say that I join with my colleagues around the Chamber about the transfer of funds – EUR 100 million – for the Ford Otosan plant in Turkey. Perhaps we should ask some questions about this. After all, I know it is not public funds, but let us ask this question. There are certain people who have been involved in this, the Commission itself offers an opinion about whether or not these funds should be transferred and so do Member States. Are we that naïve that we do not believe that such a neighbourhood policy where we give funds to countries just outside the EU will not eventually lead to job transfers? Are we that silly that we do not actually wake up and realise this is going to occur? We really need to ask a question about what the remit of the EIB is in this particular issue and get down to talking about what they should and should not be allowed to do.

What the European Union is achieving with the DSA is to hold platforms accountable for what they do and not for what their users think. So what do the platforms do? They collect data – their users’ data or the citizens’ data, because you don’t even need to have a Google or Facebook account to be spied on. And then platforms use that data to build very comprehensive profiles of every one of us, which they use for two things: sell us ads and keep us on the platforms as long as possible, recommending us content that will make us interact as long as possible, to which we are vulnerable. Unfortunately, psychological research shows that what makes us interact and stay on platforms are two emotions: anger and fear. And this is why content that arouses anger and fear goes viral in the internet: it increases platforms’ profits. That’s why the recommender systems disseminate hateful speech and disinformation at far higher speed than anything else. And it is not true that the internet is a perfect mirror of the real world. It’s a completely distorted mirror, and the content is being distorted to increase platforms’ profits. So how does the DSA increase these challenges? It starts with very basic things. Orders by national authorities need to be respected. Users have clear rights. Complaint mechanisms, independent dispute settlement will be in place. What do we do to protect citizens? We take a few steps, but we don’t go far enough. We will ban surveillance advertising for our children, for minors, but not for adults. We should have and could have done more. This week, Silicon Valley representative Anna Eshoo and others introduced a bill in the US House of Representatives to ban surveillance advertising. This is what we should have done. What we did do, and I’m very proud of this: we opened the black box that very large online platforms today represent, with risk assessments where platforms have to look into the risk their business model and their algorithms themselves present for human dignity, for example, with independent audits and with, above all, access to the data for independent research, for independent and NGOs to study and assess compliance. This way we will finally be able to shed light on the platforms’ practices, collect evidence and tell the stories of how targeting and engagement-based ranking tampers with democracies, and we will be able to build a better and freer internet. The DSA is a first step, but it is the fundamental law for the digital world, and I am extremely proud that Europe is the first democratic continent to take this important step. It will shine. Its light will shine."}

Glenys knew her subject because she had worked in the health sector as a trade union representative. Her work on the safety of medical devices was promoted by the scandal of leaking breast-implants; an issue that seriously threatened the health of women, and I am proud that we have real experts in our political group working for the benefit of all Europeans, and I have to say that my colleague Mrs McGuinness is correct: Brexit threatens the future health of people in the UK and Ireland. It also threatens research: ground-breaking research is what makes medicines and health innovations possible – and outside of the EU, the UK is taking a retrograde step in terms of its position on the world stage."}

These authorities appoint officials to implement democratic decisions. It would therefore be absurd for these elected representatives and appointed officials to be entitled to withhold information from their electorate. The fact that this happens nevertheless has two explanations. The first is a legacy from a pre-democratic society where the people were seen as subjects under non-elected rulers. The subjects were not permitted to interfere in the ruler’s affairs. The second is that the nation’s security, consideration of citizens’ integrity, business secrets, market influence and similar considerations may require exceptions to transparency. The first explanation is completely irrelevant today. The authorities must not, in their capacity as authorities, withhold information from the people. The second explanation, however, is sound and involves a difficult balancing act. These legitimate demands for finding the right balance are, unfortunately, often used by the authorities to preserve the option of secretiveness. The EU does not have a proud tradition of transparency. In its childhood and early youth, the EU was almost totally secret, even down to the Commission’s internal telephone directory. The EU began as a mandarin empire, and still is today, but important steps have been taken: the 1993 Code of Conduct, the acceptance of the Swedish Journalists’ Association’s demands in 1998, and the Regulation in 2001. It is with a certain amount of pride that I note that my own country, Sweden, has the longest historical tradition of statutory transparency. That was why the Swedish state became involved in the Turco case and got the European Court of Justice to override the Council and the Court of First Instance last summer. This was yet another step away from the mandarin empire, but the road to establishing democratic transparency in the EU is a long one. There is a lot of internal resistance to quash. Mr Cappato’s report should therefore receive the full support of this House, which would be yet another step forward along that long road."}

The current regulatory framework is not sufficiently equipped to deal with the increasing digitalisation of the financial sector. Well-targeted derogations from existing legislation should allow our capital markets to take advantage of the opportunities offered by this technology. We welcome the creation of a testing ground for the use of digital ledger technology in this field, with the potential for countless innovations. DLT offers, for example, the opportunity to reimagine clearing and settlement in a true, borderless 24—7 operating environment, providing access to securities and cash pools to facilitate real—time settlements, delivering at near—100% settlement rates. With the vote on the DLT pilot regime tomorrow, we are taking a quantum leap towards the much—needed further digitalisation of our capital markets. Therefore, I congratulate the rapporteur and Parliament’s negotiating team for a job well done."}

It is estimated that EU consumers lose up to EUR 12 billion each year by opting to buy new goods instead of repairing, and the option to repair is not always available. This legislation will remove those obstacles by ensuring that products can be repaired within the legal guarantee, that consumers have easier and cheaper options to repair goods when the guarantee is expired, that strong provisions will be in place to ensure independent repairers can easily repair products without restrictions by the manufacturers. This will be supported by provisions to ensure affordable spare parts that are there available, that manufacturers must disclose repair details and offer spare parts and tools at fair prices. Consumer awareness is to be facilitated through a new European online repair system, allowing them to locate repair facilities in their own State. And, of course, another major benefit of this legislation must be the impact on our environment: less waste, less use of limited natural resources. The Commission figures tell us that 261 million tonnes of CO2-equivalent emissions are generated each year by the loss of electronic waste, resulting in 35 million tonnes of waste in the EU every year. So this proposal will address those challenges, be a major contributor to our sustainability, to our circular economy, and ensure the consumers have more money in their pockets."}

As stated in this year’s State of Schengen report, the area is functioning well overall and was the most visited destination in the world last year. Schengen brings liberty and prosperity, and the absence of border checks between our Member States is cherished by Europeans and is part of European identity. It is both a legal expectation and a European promise that Member States acceding to the Union participate fully in the Schengen area once all the agreed conditions are met and – as the Commission has underlined repeatedly since 2011 – Bulgaria and Romania have continued to meet all the necessary conditions to join the Schengen area. Controls at the Romanian and Bulgarian internal borders bring extra economic and environmental burden to all EU citizens, as underlined in the petition we discussed today. Therefore, it is urgent to finalise the process that started 12 years ago and let Bulgaria and Romania become full members of Schengen. Both Member States have constantly acted as essential actors for the continuous development of the Schengen acts. They have gone beyond what was required of them and agreed on a voluntary basis to the fact—finding missions of October and November 2022 – missions which further confirmed their readiness to join the Schengen area. The Commission regrets that the Council did not reach unanimity on the decision on Romania’s and Bulgaria’s accession to the area in December 2022. Not only are these two Member States ready to become full members of the Schengen area, but equally the area is today stronger than ever before, with many challenges on their way to being addressed. Just to give a few examples, our work on the Western Balkans with the EU Action Plan we proposed in December 2022 is producing excellent results. Overall pressure on the Western Balkans route has decreased by 25% in the first five months of 2023, compared to the same period in 2022. On visas, significant decisions have been taken by the partners to align the visa policy. On border management, tangible progress has been made on the two pilot projects set up in March by Bulgaria and Romania showcasing good practices at European level in this area. Moreover, new Frontex status agreements are well under way. New operations started in mid-April in North Macedonia. We signed a new agreement with Montenegro in May, and expect to sign one with Albania in September. Negotiations are ongoing with Serbia and we expect Bosnia and Herzegovina to appoint a chief negotiator during the summer. Finally, the Regional Anti-smuggling Cooperation Partnership, launched in Tirana in November 2022, is also bringing results with increased engagement at operational level between EU Member States and the Western Balkans. We are delivering on all fronts of managing migration, and this makes our area stronger. It is high time the EU honour its commitment to grant the two Member States full membership and further strengthen the European Union in doing so. Schengen enlargement remains a political priority for this Commission, and we welcome that this is a priority also for the Spanish Presidency. The Commission is working closely with the Spanish Presidency to prepare for a decision to be taken by the Council to lift internal border controls as soon as possible this year."}

Still, railways have shown improving safety performance over the past decades. Safety should not just be for passengers and employees, but for the staff of contractors and people residing near railway lines. In order to further improve railway safety, it is necessary to take into account the expected improvement in the competitiveness of rail transport. Establishment of a common regulatory framework for railway safety with safety rules, certification and tasks, will bring better harmonisation of the system as whole. Maintaining safety is an element which should be further discussed, because at the moment safety depends on the interaction between rail infrastructure, operations, manufacturers and safety authorities. There should be appropriate tools to ensure and develop safety and all Member States should monitor and maintain networks so that local railway safety is stable and efficient."}

For many years now the European Parliament has resolutely championed the cause of human rights in Tibet. In numerous resolutions we have called for a constructive dialogue between the Chinese leadership and the Dalai Lama and respect for the human rights of the Tibetan people. In doing so, we are guided by our principles and values, of which fundamental rights are an integral part: the dignity of each and every individual, and the realisation of their own and their ethnic community's cultural and religious identity are the values we espouse. The events in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and in other Chinese cities since 10 March this year are deeply disturbing. We condemn every form of violence and the disproportionate use of the military and police. We condemn the deaths of people who were acting peacefully. We declare our solidarity with the Dalai Lama, who is a symbol of peace, understanding and compromise. We cannot allow a situation in which the Dalai Lama's name is linked with terrorism. We cannot allow the demonisation of the Dalai Lama. On a personal note, may I say that whenever I have met the Dalai Lama, the impression that I have always gained is of a person with a profound commitment to peace, reconciliation and human rights. I have every confidence and trust in the Dalai Lama and wish to convey my great respect and appreciation to him. I therefore call on those in power in Beijing to negotiate with the Dalai Lama and, while upholding the territorial integrity of China, to reach an understanding that respects and guarantees the cultural and religious identity of the Tibetan people. The Dalai Lama has accepted our invitation to address the European Parliament as part of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue, and this has been scheduled for the month of December. However, I hope you will agree that in light of recent events in Tibet, the Dalai Lama is welcome here in the European Parliament at any time. Dialogue and cooperation between the European Union and China are in our mutual interests. China is a great nation and we wish to cooperate with China on the basis of partnership. In a few months' time, China will host the Olympic Games. We want these Games to be a success. However, there are certain preconditions for this: respect for the cultural and religious identity of the Tibetan people, and free and fair reporting before and during the games. The fact that journalists and correspondents have been expelled from Tibet must therefore be condemned. As someone who was very pleased to be attending the opening ceremony of the Games in Beijing together with the Presidents of the other institutions, let me make one thing very clear, here and now, in the plenary sitting of the European Parliament: every politician with a sense of responsibility must ask themselves whether they can take part in the opening ceremony if the Chinese leadership does not seek dialogue and compromise. Ladies and gentlemen, we wish to make our contribution so that the world's athletes can meet in fair and free competition in Beijing. However, our values and our self-respect will not allow us to surrender our principles. We in the European Parliament have a special responsibility in this regard."}
{"id": "42877b22-6fdf-4786-93f0-c7595cbe8dfb", "text": "Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner and honourable Members for this debate on data protection adequacy. The Council believes that the EU must find the best solution to make the transfer of personal data possible to a European Economic Area third country, territory or international organisation, while at the same time respecting EU legislation and case-law. When the conditions are fulfilled, adequacy decisions should be adopted. This is in line with the European Council Conclusions of October 2020, in which the heads of state or government welcomed the European strategy for data. This strategy supports the European Union’s global digital ambition to build a true European competitive data economy while ensuring values and a high level of data security, data protection and privacy. As you know, the Council itself does not take part in the adoption of adequacy decisions, although Member States are involved in the comitology procedures. This being said, let’s look at the transfer of personal data to the UK. According to the Commission explanations provided in the draft decision, the UK has chosen to keep its data protection framework fully aligned with the EU rules. The UK has strong safeguards in the area of government access to data and therefore provides an equivalent to data protection. These elements are essential, both to safeguard economic activity and to maintain a high level of cooperation with the UK in different sectors, including law—enforcement cooperation. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) provides for a maximum of six months during which the UK is not to be considered a third country for the purpose of transferring personal data, and, as you know, this period expires at the end of June. After the draft adequacy decisions have been presented by the Commission and the European Data Protection Board provides its opinion, the process of adopting the adequacy decisions should be completed in time to make sure that there is a solid legal base for the transfer of personal data with the UK. So, we will continue to support the Commission to come up with solutions that at the same time respect the fundamental rights of the Union and the TCA timeframe. That is essential, both to safeguard economic activity, in particular for SMEs and startups, and to maintain a high level of cooperation with the UK in different sectors, including law enforcement, as I said, and judicial cooperation. The UK will continue to be a very important partner of the European Union in these areas. Besides, adequacy decisions are not the end of the story – it is always important to keep an eye on evolution in the third state concerned, and the adequacy decisions provide for such a mechanism, in addition to the well—known sunset clause. This is also an important safeguard as it is important to make sure that the UK maintains a high level of protection of personal data in the future, and, if there are problematic divergences, this will certainly have consequences. Now let’s talk about the transfer of personal data to the United States. Turning to this point, it is clear that the invalidation of the Privacy Shield by the European Court of Justice has important implications, even if the Court upheld the validity of the standard contractual clauses. These standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data will soon be updated, and they play an important role by providing additional legal certainty. We are confident that negotiations will intensify, following the joint statement by Commissioner Reynders and the US Secretary of Commerce, Gina Raimondo, of 25 March. The Council and the Member States are following these negotiations closely on the basis of information provided by the Commission and I look forward to hearing Commissioner Reynders speak on this topic."}

The threats posed by organised criminal groups trafficking in drugs is increasing in all EU countries. According to the serious and organised crime threat assessment prepared by Europol, 40 % of criminal networks engage in drugs trafficking. The increased criminal activities of organised groups have led to a wave also of extreme violence. Criminal groups threaten democratic values by using corruption to undermine our institutions and, of course, also the rule of law. The production and trafficking of illegal drugs is also a threat, obviously, to the health of EU citizens. We see an unprecedented increase in the availability in illicit drugs, while those are often more affordable and have a high potency and purity. This means that more people may have access to drugs and that those drugs may be at greater risk, and those who use those drugs may be at greater risk of adverse health outcomes, including poisoning and death. We have a good basis for action in the EU drugs strategy 2021–2025 and the EU strategy to tackle organised crime, also 2021–2025. And the Commission considers that the European Union’s drugs agency needs additional competences, tools and resources to better address the health and security dimension of the drugs phenomenon. And we want the agency’s work to be forward looking, as also mentioned by several today. The Commission’s proposal sought to expand the agency’s mandate to cover product supplies, as well as poly drug use and to better equip it to forecast and analyse how these is increasing. All the changes to the agency’s mandate are important and necessary in order to ensure that it can play a greater role at the EU and, of course, internationally. The Commission thanks, wholeheartedly, the rapporteur, Ms Santos, and the shadow rapporteurs for an excellent cooperation and a great work on this important file. Our aim is to ensure a quick and full application of the new mandates by mid-24. For that, the Commission, of course, encourages Parliament to adopt the new mandate for the agency on Thursday. Thank you very much and thank you for the cooperation."}

But experience shows that diplomacy and perseverance pay off since, in the overwhelming majority of cases, we manage to find solutions to overcome our differences and break the deadlock. True, this takes countless hours of talks and efforts to understand each other’s positions. Translating sometimes into late night or early morning compromises like we have been experiencing these days. But this is how the Union works. The number of files which remain blocked over prolonged periods of time is rather insignificant, statistically speaking. Our swift reaction to the recent crisis shows our unity and capacity to find agreement in the interest of us all. I would like to recall that unanimity is a voting modality provided by the treaties, albeit currently an exception from the rule, which is qualified majority voting, unanimity is typically applicable to decisions in the common foreign and security policy area. Well, treaties require the Council to act unanimously; the Act can only be adopted when Member States vote in favour. But, importantly, the treaty provides that abstentions do not prevent the act from being adopted. In the area of the common foreign and security policy, there is also the so-called constructive abstention, which allows a Member State that uses this possibility not to apply the adopted decision while permitting the Union to go forward. This is what has been successfully used in the context of the European Peace Facility. While there is a lot we can do through discussions and persuasion, a Member State remains free when expressing its vote in the Council, and this is a fundamental element of our European democracy. After all, Council members are responsible towards their citizens and their national parliaments for the action, including how they vote in the Council. Treaty change would, of course, be one of the possible avenues that may also be considered to bring more areas under qualified majority voting. However, as you know, it is a very heavy procedure. This possibility has been discussed in the follow up to the Conference on the Future of Europe. More importantly, in many areas, it is possible to switch from unanimity to qualified majority voting without modifying the treaties. Indeed, the treaties contain one general and the six specific so-called passerelle clauses. They allow the European Council or the Council also acting by unanimity, but through a simple procedure, to switch to a qualified majority in the Council. As a follow up to the Conference on the Future of Europe the Council has started discussing the possible use of passerelle clauses to switch to qualified majority. The Czech Presidency has notably initiated exploratory discussions on this issue, focusing on the common foreign and security policy. I look very much forward to hearing your views. I will have to leave the room for a short while as I have a duty to sign several legislative acts together with President Metsola. But my colleagues will be here and report to me afterwards. My personal and friendly advice to honourable Members would be to, instead of attacking the Council as the institution, rather focus the energy on reaching out towards national parliaments, as these are the bodies that national governments are accountable to."}

For those who are expecting to have more Europe, there are two serious challenges in building trust from below, in projecting political power from above, and in proper management of the situation.

It has also been endorsed by the new Member States and the candidate countries who have, in the meantime, set up national drug strategies and improved their capacities for taking action against drugs with the support of the Phare Programme. The Union also has a number of drug action plans involving certain regions either producing or serving as transit countries for drugs, such as Latin America, Central Asia and the Balkans. Research shows that a link between a particular drug policy line and the drug situation is difficult to establish. The availability and careful evaluation of relevant and reliable information are undoubtedly key elements in developing an evidence-based drug policy. The work of the European Monitoring Centre on Drugs and Drug Addiction and the work of Europol in this area form part of the basis for the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament on the mid-term evaluation of the EU Action Plan on Drugs. This mid-term evaluation was a first step in a larger process. By the end of this year we will have the final evaluation. Without wanting to pre-empt the results of the final evaluation, the following developments on the EU drugs market can already be observed. Heroin seizures have increased since 2001. Our assessment is that street prices are generally stable or even decreasing. The number of heroin addicts seems to be relatively stable in the European Union, although there are marked differences between the Member States. Cannabis remains the most widely-used illicit drug and its use is still increasing in many Member States. The use of synthetic drugs such as ecstasy and the use of cocaine seem to be increasing in certain population groups, although the use of these drugs among the general population remains low."}

The European Union has every reason to safeguard the leading role which it plays in this economic sector and to maintain a high standard of maritime transport. This is the challenge: to maintain our leading role in the global shipping market, which is why we need an effective and coordinated maritime transport strategy. The report we are debating today, which was adopted by an overwhelming majority in the competent committee, is a detailed report which moves in the right direction, and I consider that, even as it now stands, without changes and amendments, the text responds fully to the need for us to move along a specific fixed line in the direction I referred to earlier. Of course, European shipping faces huge challenges at present, as well as an exogenous challenge. The first challenge is the need to increase competition. It is a fact that free competition is the life blood of shipping. At the same time, however, State aid is often needed, because we frequently have to cope with unfair competition from third countries. So the conclusion is this: State aid must be kept, because it has helped to maintain the competitiveness of European shipping and of the economy of the Member States. The second challenge we face is the need to strengthen and improve vocational training of human resources in the shipping sector, because there has been a spectacular reduction in the number of young people entering the profession and there is a lack of trained seafarers. We therefore need a dynamic policy. We must, without fail, address these two sectors and I believe that the report moves in the right direction."}

Even though we may take a different line on some amendments, you should not take that as indicating any opposition to helping the sick. Speaking personally, I do agree with Mr Mikolášik and with the amendments from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market that have now been brought back in by Mr Gargani, Mr Morillon, Mrs Auken and others, which – and this is something you need to know, too – represent the position taken by the overwhelming majority of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, as determined by a vote we took last Wednesday. I would like to turn to a subject that has not featured in this debate so far, but is very important if we want to know how we can create the right conditions for the companies that want to help patients. There is at present a whole array of small and medium-sized enterprises that are already carrying out treatments in hospitals, whether the people treated are in-patients or outpatients. Quite some time ago, these firms came to me and told me that, if the regulation goes through unamended and without easier arrangements for small and medium-sized businesses under national licensing schemes, they would no longer be able to offer those services. That, rather than this or that promise of miracle cures, is what we need to bear in mind – the real live businesses that are there today helping patients and who say that the proposal for a Commission regulation is not as good as it is made out to be. Nor does the so-called compromise package offer the small and medium-sized businesses a proper solution for their problem. Amendment 127 provides for SMEs working in tandem with a hospital to be exempted from the requirement for a European license. SMEs working outside hospitals, though, and facing fewer risks, are obliged to go to London to get their licences, incurring many charges and having a complicated process to go through. As one Member of this House always says, there are times when consensus becomes nonsensical, and this is one of them, thanks to those who cobbled together this so-called compromise. Commissioner Verheugen said that we are not talking about ethics. He went on to say that the principle that the human body must not become a commodity has been complied with. What now, then? Are we going to talk about it or are we not? If the principle has been taken into account, then a European regulation on the subject exists, and, that being so, we have to examine whether or not it is any good. Having been a rapporteur on this, I know that this House wanted more stringent regulation, but, back then, the Commission said no, citing the legal basis. The legal basis has now changed, and so you ought at the least to think up a proper justification, rather than simply saying that the matter has been taken care of. We need this regulation; I am all for us getting it, and have been so for the past five years. For three of them, it was on ice in the Commission – not, admittedly, on Commissioner Verheugen’s watch, but the Commission does nevertheless bear responsibility for this three-year delay. Mrs Roth-Behrendt, Mrs Ries and others bear responsibility for another six months’ delay, having rejected the report back in September. Now you are giving us another month in which this House has to talk the matter through in proper parliamentary fashion."}

You have to play the game of the European institutions. The European Parliament is at the heart of parliamentary democracy. It is not a question of availability; it is a question of priority. The Presidency needs the European Parliament and is therefore at its disposal. If the speakers will excuse me, I would like to say a few words to each of them. First of all I would like to say to Mr Bushill-Matthews that I am among those who think that Europe needs the United Kingdom. I have never been one of those Europeans or French people who thought that we should be wary of our British friends. The United Kingdom can bring much more than it believes it can to Europe. The United Kingdom is the gateway to the Anglo-Saxon world, it represents the leading world language and it is economically dynamic, as has been shown in recent years. I would like to say to our British Conservative friends, ‘believe that Europe needs you, that you have a place there, and that if the British have one foot in and one foot out, Europe will be weakened’. The United Kingdom is a great nation. It has nothing to fear from Europe, and Europe has a great deal to expect from the United Kingdom. To Mr Poignant, who saw deep inside me and therefore understood that I loved politics and that Parliament was a little like my garden, I would like to say that yes, Parliament is the place for democracy, and I do not respect or understand those political leaders who would not be happy to express and defend their ideas in the cradle of parliamentary democracy. I hope that in your remark there was an element of regret, rather than an excessive view of the harmonisation of the employment market. The same also applies to Mr Désir; I am entirely with you, I am against complete harmonisation because the people would reject it. However, having minimum rules in the context of an employment market, in the context of a single economic market, is perfectly natural. Let us all be aware of the difficulties. Take Austria, for example, which is led by a socialist Prime Minister and Government; they will tell you that the retirement age is 65, and that the contribution period is 45 years. You are aware of how many difficulties I encountered in bringing the contribution period to 40 years, and I did not immediately gain the support of the French Socialist Party. So explain to me how it is, when I encountered so many difficulties in securing a 40-year contribution period in France, I only need to be President of Europe for six months to preferably achieve between the 45 years of contributions in Austria and the 40 years in France. How can that be done? It is a long way from the dream to the reality, but this is perhaps the difference between the French Socialist Party and the European Socialist Party. At times I even feel closer to the European Socialist Party than to the French Socialist Party; I confess my fault and of course apologise for it."}

The European Commission apparently does – and Parliament, disgracefully, has just missed an important opportunity to block their proposals and stand up for the rights and safety of passengers, pilots and cabin crew alike. It has been pointed out many times over by experts and pilots’ associations alike that the commission’s proposals are not scientifically based and that they pose a threat to safety. Doing up to eight hours of standby duties followed by up to 14 hours of flight duties is fundamentally unsafe. The privatisation of the aviation sector, together with neoliberal reforms, has led to a race to the bottom in the industry – a race led by the likes of Ryanair. In such a climate the desire to make a quick profit is put ahead of safety. I want to express my solidarity with all pilots and crew who waged an important struggle against this revision. This struggle must continue, and as much pressure as possible should be put on the Commission by means of escalating protests, including industrial action."}

I think that our greatest priority as MEPs, and the greatest priority of the Council and the Commission, should be to stop the bombing of the people of Gaza. I think that is our duty at the moment, above and beyond deciding who is responsible and above and beyond the differences among us on that point. I must say that our group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, has rather a clear idea on this, as we will say this afternoon. Mr President, you began your observations by speaking of medieval times, an age that was violent, remote, dark with a few lights, but certainly violent and dark. In fact, regardless of the efforts of your coalition partners, the programme for these six months seems to us to bear the strong stamp of a slightly passé vision, let us say; the strong mark of a conformist, ultra laissez-faire approach, dominated by business and the market, which is now, Mr President, out of fashion. I think that it is also a little indifferent with regard to the need for policies, laws and instruments on social issues that meet the real needs of citizens, and a little off-track in its view of environmental policy on the fight against climate change as a cost or an obstacle, instead of a major opportunity for innovation and sustainable growth. It even, if you will permit me, leans a little towards machismo, in saying that there is a need to review the Barcelona objectives on support structures for children, naturally with the aim of sending women back to the home. This then, is a programme that sees migrants solely as a security issue, that looks to NATO rather than to multilateralism, that is still toying with the missiles issue, and does not really place the emphasis on what for us is truly important in foreign policy, namely cohesion: the cohesion of our Union. Nor are we pleased with the fact that no mention is made of such an important sector as that of combating discrimination, and on this point I would like to know what priority you place on adopting the directive on discrimination. To sum up, this is a programme that reveals a world with many dangers and few opportunities. You spoke of your mediation work in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine over gas, but it can be seen very clearly from your programme that it will not be during your Presidency that clear action is taken against those countries, such as Slovakia and Bulgaria, that are taking the opportunity presented by the gas crisis to reopen dangerous, obsolete nuclear plants. Additionally, Mr President, please remember that there is no safe nuclear power; perhaps there will be in 30, 40, 50 or 60 years – I do not know – but right now it does not exist. It is therefore not worth discussing it, because it is a very expensive mirage, and certainly distracts us from our real priorities. Energy security and solidarity can be achieved through strong action, with no distractions, to promote energy efficiency and energy saving, which is an enormous sphere for innovation, employment and reduction of consumption. This is the roadmap that we should use to respond to the gas war, among other things. We are making a specific request to you, Mr President; we are asking you to persuade your colleagues to place at the heart of the spring European Council the aim of making a binding commitment to the target of 20% energy cuts by 2020, the Cinderella of the energy package last year, and to review your priorities by assessing in a less superficial manner the decisions taken in December regarding renewable energy. Mr President, one last word on the future of Europe: the Treaty of Lisbon is not perfect, but it is really strange that you have not yet ratified it. Therefore, please, take this opportunity to explain to us why, and to tell us when you will do so."}

It shares Parliament’s recognition of the important role the EIB has to play in supporting the Europe 2020 objectives. In this context, we particularly welcome the capital increase recently approved by the EIB governors, which will generate EUR 60 billion of additional lending over the next three years. While the Commission recognises the importance of the AAA rating of the Bank and the need to properly manage portfolio risks, it is critically important that the EIB deploys fresh funds to high-value-added projects across the 27 Member States, including vulnerable and programme countries for which funds are not available from other sources, on reasonable terms. For example, EIB activity in 2012 has been decisive in providing much-needed support in Greece and Portugal. The Bank provided substantial amounts and support for school facilities throughout Greece, as well as for development of environmentally friendly energy production. Small- and mid-capitalisation businesses play a key role in the Greek and Portuguese economies, and EIB funding has helped them gain access to credit, despite the difficult market conditions. We also welcome Parliament’s support for deepening the cooperation between the EIB and the Commission in developing innovative financial instruments such as loan-grant blending and risk-sharing mechanisms. These instruments are very efficient tools for combining and leveraging the limited resources from the EU budget, the EIB and other European institutions to promote growth and employment in Europe. Therefore the Commission has proposed to considerably expand their use under COSME, Horizon 2020 and the Connecting Europe Facility. Moreover, to further improve the impact of the EU intervention, we should continue exploring synergies between EIB financing and structural funds. A clear example is the pilot phase of the project bonds initiative. The scheme is up and running and managed by the EIB. The EU budget contribution of EUR 230 million is expected to raise around EUR 4.5 billion in project costs. The project bonds initiative has two objectives: to revive project bond markets, and to help the promoters of individual infrastructure projects to attract long-term private-sector debt financing. The project pipeline is good, with both TEN-T and TEN-E infrastructure projects, all of which could be allocated in 2013, following the finalisation of the tendering procedures. The positive feedback from market participants provides confidence about this new way of financing infrastructure projects in the EU and, more generally, on the use of innovative instruments in support of the Europe 2020 Strategy. We consider that a major challenge for the EIB in the years to come will be to refine its business model in light of the new market circumstances, notably the deleveraging of the private banking sector, the limited investment budget available to Member States, and the growing relevance of public investment banks. In this context, the EIB should use its catalytic capacity to attract resources from the capital markets to support EU priority investments. At the same time, it should reinforce and streamline its cooperation with public investment banks in Member States. We share the EIB’s view that one-size-fits-all is not an option, in particular in the current circumstances. In order to generate growth, the EIB has to adapt its lending programme to the needs and necessities of each Member State while at the same time, focusing on EU added value. Consequently, the EIB investment strategies have to be closely aligned with the priorities identified in the Annual Growth Survey and the European Semester of Economic Governance. As regards the EIB’s external activity, a substantial level of EIB involvement in the pre-accession and neighbourhood countries is essential and in line with the EU’s political and strategic priorities. The EIB’s investment activity in these regions is still of fundamental importance to facilitate the accession process and the EU support to its neighbourhood, while other, more distant, regions will also benefit from support from other international financial institutions. As you may be aware, the Commission is currently preparing the proposal for the future mandate and the next financial framework, which should be submitted to Parliament and the Council in the coming months."}

Firstly, to repeat, it is important that we sign the interim EPA because, if we do not, existing trade preferences for Papua New Guinea and Fiji will disappear, under the WTO ruling. The interim EPA is precisely that: it is an interim arrangement, and I agree with all the colleagues who say that our objective in the long run should be a full, comprehensive EPA with all the Pacific countries, encouraging regional integration in the Pacific. But we have to take this step at the moment to ensure the continuation of preferences for the two largest countries in the Pacific region. On fishing, the Commission has made it very clear that what we have here is an exception. This will be the only derogation. There are no other parts of the world to which we intend giving such a derogation. Why are we giving a derogation to Papua New Guinea? I will tell you: it is because Papua New Guinea is literally on the other side of the world, and the likelihood of EU fishing fleets exploiting that area extensively is limited, although they are free to do so. There is nothing to stop EU fishing fleets fishing in Papua New Guinea waters and landing their catch and getting their catch canned in Papua New Guinea – and, as has been said earlier, that would be very good for development, and indeed we should encourage it. But the situation at present is that Chinese boats, Thai boats and boats of other Asian nationalities are fishing in Papua New Guinea’s waters and landing their fish back in their own country, giving no opportunity for development in Papua New Guinea. There is a development opportunity here in terms of providing jobs, particularly for women. We often complain that we do not do enough in our development policy to encourage downstream activity. Here, we are actually doing something positive for downstream activity. As the Commissioner has said, in order to qualify, the fish still needs to meet all the standards under the regulation on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. It has to meet all our sanitary and phytosanitary conditions. That is absolutely essential. The three factories in Papua New Guinea meet these standards at the moment and are providing useful jobs. If we have a sudden increase in the number of factories, and a sudden surge in imports from Papua New Guinea, then, of course, we will have to revisit the situation and potentially take action. At the moment, however, the statistics speak for themselves. This agreement has been in place since 2008. There has been no surge. There is no threat to the European tuna industry. I have met, as rapporteur, with the leaders of the Spanish tuna industry and they themselves have said to me that there is no current threat. What they are worried about is the future. They accept that at the moment, there is no serious threat to the EU industry. So let us not exaggerate the situation. Let us not make a poor developing country pay for our preoccupation with our own self-interest."}

Mr Sterckx stated that we all agreed with the aim of having a single EU format, although some differences undoubtedly exist. He was referring, in particular, to administrative renewal of licences for the elderly. In my view, this is an area which, in general, requires greater attention. By way of example: I fly a totally harmless machine, one which does not even have an engine. I believe that in the event of an accident, the only victim would be myself and, at most, one other person. Despite that, I am required, in Italy, to take out compulsory insurance, undergo a medical examination every two years and submit to a raft of administrative and other requirements which, frankly, appear excessive when compared to the level of danger to society represented by a motor vehicle which, in the event of an accident, can cause carnage. Accordingly, we have to be very careful. The issue is, therefore, to harmonise an area with significant consequences on the lives of citizens and with obvious social implications for motorists’ behaviour. Thus, we need to harmonise not only a document – it is not just a question of switching from a paper licence to a plastic one – but also people’s performance at the wheel. To this end, we need to ensure that police are able to identify with certainty a driver who may be infringing the Highway Code. I should also like to mention particularly the amendments submitted jointly with some fellow Members concerning the introduction of the AM licence for mopeds. I believe we should be grateful to users of 2-wheeled means of transport because, particularly in countries in southern Europe, they contribute to resolving serious traffic problems, help our environment and improve the quality of life in towns and cities, particularly those with an older, more traditional urban fabric. All dangerous behaviour must be punished and prevented, and there is no shortage of ways of achieving this. However, penalising two-wheeled traffic, which this directive does in part, will, in my view, damage not only our economies but also the quality of life in general."}

Procedures should be clearer, more precise and more transparent. I endorse the need for a clear and precise definition of the concept of disaster, setting a general criterion for assessing the severity of damage caused, and for thresholds to be established geared to the appropriate territorial level. This would help to remove doubts and negative attitudes to the European Union among both Member States and the public, which may otherwise believe that the Union does not offer an appropriate response to their problems.

First of all, to provide legal certainty to all stakeholders, including companies. Second of all, to play an active role in ongoing global efforts through the G7 Process, OECD and the UN.

The draft regulation sets out the conditions in terms of location, character, financial situation and professional competence which a person must fulfil to be able to perform the occupation of a road transport operator. The regulation which we are discussing has also established the terms under which a company can employ a transport manager, has reinforced authorisation and monitoring procedures, has provided regulations for electronic registers and the protection of electronic data, has dealt with the issue of penalties for non-compliance with the regulation and has set up a system of mutual recognition of diplomas and prior rights. At first reading, which ended with a plenary session vote in May last year, Parliament insisted that the transport manager have a proper contractual link to the company and imposed an upper limit on the number of vehicles one manager could manage. Amendments were also introduced to tighten the requirements for the company to have a fixed location. The company’s good reputation may be lost as a result of its involvement in human or drugs trafficking. Parliament has drawn up a list of serious infringements leading to exclusion from the profession in conjunction with removing provisions on minor infringements. Insurance has been accepted as proof of financial standing and the quick ratio of assets to debts has been dropped. A compulsory written examination in the country of residence has been retained as a requirement to practice this occupation, with the possibility of an exemption for 10 years’ continuous practical experience. Finally, previous rights have been rescinded and the Commission has been asked to report on the likely impact of extending the regulation to commercial transport using vehicles with the appropriate design and equipment, intended to carry up to nine persons including the driver. The Common Position has adopted in whole or in substance 70 of Parliament’s 113 amendments. These include amendments on minor infringements, the definition of the link between companies and transport managers, the right of appeal of those subject to decisions on operating as a transport manager, mutual recognition of certificates, prior rights, the exchange of information between the competent authorities, as well as drugs and human trafficking as grounds for exclusion from the profession. Concerning the registers, both Parliament and the Council agree on a stepwise approach. In fact, the Commission will define the data structure for national electronic registers by the end of 2009, but the two institutions have proposed different timetables for implementation, with the Council requesting a longer period of time. There have also been other issues where the Council’s initial stance was different to that of Parliament, but after long, fruitful negotiations, an acceptable compromise was reached for both institutions. As a result, Parliament has accepted a more flexible timetable for implementing and interconnecting national electronic registers (31 December 2012). It has been agreed that major infringements will only be incorporated in national electronic registers after 2015, the limit on the period of validity for authorisation to perform the occupation of road transport operator will be removed, the examination will be retained in the Member State of residence, the structure of the electronic registers will include a public and a confidential section, the references in the regulation’s content to restricting licences for accessing the road transport market will be removed, where virtually all the references to the licences for accessing the road transport market are only contained in Mr Grosch’s two regulations.

They are hard to change and that is why it’s so important that the rules of the game are well designed. But so far they are blind on the environment and the climate, they are quite weak on human rights, this is what we need to change and this is why the trade policy review is so timely. 10% of worldwide deforestation is linked to EU imports. A quarter of worldwide CO2 emissions are linked to trade. We need to make urgently all trade, whether multilateral or bilateral, climate proof. We need a climate supremacy clause, rules to phase out fossil fuels subsidies and clear CO2 reduction commitments. The EU is proud of its sustainability chapters. Yes, I admit they look nice, but looking nice is not their purpose. They need to be effective – and how effective is a TSD chapter if there are no consequences after trade unionist murders in Colombia or when, after nine years, South Korea still hasn’t ratified the ILO Convention on freedom of association for workers?

This Parliament kept the EU’s accession to the Council of Europe’s Istanbul Convention high on the European political agenda for many years. Almost six years have passed since the EU signed this convention. Meanwhile, the situation for women has not improved. Violence against women and domestic violence remain a widespread pan-European phenomenon and a manifestation of discrimination against women. In order to address the data collection requirements of the Istanbul Convention, Eurostat is currently running an EU-wide survey on violence against women. The data collection spans four years and results are published in groups of countries depending on reported data. The recently published results from the first seven Member States show high prevalence. The proportion of women who have experienced unwanted behaviour of a sexual nature at the workplace in these seven EU countries ranges from 11% to 41%. These figures show why we need to step up our efforts, and this includes through the EU’s accession to the Istanbul Convention. I appreciate that there is a strong support in this House and across Member States towards this goal. I welcome the Swedish Presidency’s engagement and the prioritisation of the EU’s accession to the Istanbul Convention, as well as the ambition to progress the negotiations towards an EU directive combating violence against women and domestic violence. Let us use the momentum and move towards the ratification of the Istanbul Convention at a Union level now. The Commission stands ready to support. We have taken concrete actions beyond the legislative framework. The Commission learnt from years of implementation of the Istanbul Convention, as well as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women in several EU Member States that this complex phenomenon requires a comprehensive approach. In this regard, your call for enhanced support to civil society organisations working with the women victims of violence has been addressed. Under the EUR 1.55 billion Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values funding programme, the Daphne strand is dedicated to preventing and combating – at all levels – all forms of gender-based violence against women and girls, including online violence, and to supporting and protecting all direct and indirect victims of such violence. The Daphne strand was substantially increased in comparison to its predecessor, the Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme, with an expected EUR 200 million specifically dedicated to combating gender-based violence throughout the course of the programme. Currently a call for proposals is published with an envelope of nearly EUR 25 million, which aims to select intermediaries to re-grant funding to civil society organisations active at local, regional and national level to prevent and combat gender-based violence. This re-granting mechanism will make EU funding on gender-based violence more accessible for grassroots civil society organisations. By the end of the year, Eurostat will publish further data from its EU-wide survey on violence against women in 18 Member States. This means we will have up-to-date, comparable data across the 27 Member States, thanks to your persistent and longstanding call for it. We know that a substantial number of violent experiences are not reported or officially recorded. It is therefore key to conduct population surveys in addition to administrative data to get the full picture. A comprehensive set of data will enable the Commission and the co-legislators to design and implement evidence-based policy and legal measures targeted to the needs of those exposed to violence. I thank this Assembly for its ambitious vision to achieve gender equality, eradicate all forms of discrimination against women, and with that, gender—based violence."}

I am here replacing Commissioner Dalli, who cannot be here today for other obligations. As President von der Leyen said in her State of the Union speech in 2020, I quote ‘Being yourself is not your ideal ideology. It is your identity, and no one can ever take it away.’ This view has underpinned the Commission’s work during this mandate, in our quest to advancing LGBTIQ rights and fighting anti-LGBTIQ narratives and to build a union of equality. Our first ever LGBTIQ equality strategy 2020 to 2025 has been a milestone to enhance LGBTIQ equality in the Union. Let me highlight some of the concrete actions put in place to fight discrimination, hate crimes and hate speech targeting LGBTIQ persons. Anti-LGBTIQ bills and narratives fuel LGBTIQ-phobic hate speech. Reports from civil society organisations confirm rising levels of violence and hatred against LGBTIQ people globally, including across the European Union. The results of the seventh evaluation of the Code of Conduct on countering illegal hate speech online revealed that sexual orientation is the third most reported category of hate speech; it is about 15%. While racist and xenophobic hate crimes and hate speech are already prohibited under European Union law, the same protection should be extended to other groups, including the LGBTIQ community. On 21 December, the Commission proposed to the Council to adopt a decision to include hate crimes and hate speech in the list of particularly serious crimes with a cross-border dimension – so-called EU crimes. If this proposal is adopted, the Commission would then be able to propose legislation to combat hate speech and hate crime on grounds including sexual orientation. In addition, the landmark Digital Service Act compels platforms to remove hateful content quickly and protects sensitive personal data from use in targeted advertising, including data on sexual orientation. In 2023, the Commission will also provide EUR 1.2 million for a dedicated joint project with the Council of Europe tackling online and offline violence against LGBTIQ people. On legal protection, we have proposed binding standards to strengthen the independence and powers of equality bodies in the Member States. The proposal, among other things, extends the remit of their work to cover discrimination based on sexual orientation in employment and occupation. We have proposed to harmonise national rules on private international law related to parenthood. This proposal will ensure that the fundamental rights of all children are respected and protected in cross-border situations within the Union. The recent proposal amending the Victims Rights Directive also includes provisions that will serve to protect LGBTIQ people through access to support services, psychological support and victim helplines, and including protection orders in the list of protection measures that are available to victims. We are continuing to facilitate dialogue and support Member States with high-level and working groups on combating hate speech and hate crime, non-discrimination, equality and diversity, but also in education, which is key to preventing stereotypes and anti-LGBTIQ narratives. This continuous exchange will help ensure our union of equality is built on strong national foundations. But we are working also on a mid-term review of the implementation of the LGBTIQ equality strategy. It will assess how the situation of LGBTIQ people has evolved, what progress has been achieved and which areas require further focus to fully implement the strategy by 2025. We are currently engaging in consultation activities to prepare this. Finally, as the guardian of the Treaties, the Commission pays close attention to potential breaches of Union law. The Commission has not shied away from launching infringement procedures when faced with concrete evidence. The Commission has an equally vigilant approach with regard to EU funds, which have to benefit all EU citizens without any form of discrimination, including on the grounds of sexual orientation. All EU-funded projects have to comply with EU law, including the Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights. In that respect, I look forward to our debate."}

Mahsa Amini was abused and died in custody at the hands of the morality police. There is only one word to describe this tragic event – outrage. We have seen brave Iranian women and men taking to the streets to express their dissent. Women have emerged as a major driver of nationwide protest movements, calling for the full enjoyment of fundamental rights for all Iranians. Despite our repeated calls for restraint to the Iranian security forces, the use of disproportionate force against protesters continues. And there is still no clarity from Iran on the number of people who have been killed or arrested during the protests. This is unacceptable. Those responsible for the death of Mahsa Amini and all perpetrators of violence in the ensuing peaceful demonstrations must be held accountable. Recent calls by Iranian officials and lawmakers to impose the death penalty on protesters are a cause of extreme concern. The death penalty is, in all cases, an unacceptable denial of human dignity and integrity. The EU is a staunch supporter of its universal abolition. We are appalled by the reports that some protesters have already received or will receive harsh sentences, including to death. The EU will not remain silent. We will continue to react and raise our concerns about the human rights situation in Iran, including with the Iranian Government at all levels. This debate is a timely opportunity to recall the swift response to the EU and to reflect on the way forward. On 25 September, the High Representative Josep Borrell issued a strong declaration on behalf of the 27 EU Member States and, swiftly after the Foreign Affairs Council on 17 October and 14 November, the Council added 40 individuals and seven entities to the list of those subject to EU restrictive measures in the context of the Iran humanitarian rights sanction regime. We took good note of the EP resolution of 6 October on the death of Mahsa Amini and the repression of women’s rights protesters in Iran. It testifies to the quick and crucial reaction of this House to any attempt to crack down on fundamental rights and freedoms. Let me reiterate that Iran’s retaliatory measures, including on members of its parliament, are unacceptable as an attempt to sanction our democratic institutions and our core principles.

It goes without saying that 128 million potential customers in high-wage Japan offer very attractive prospects for European companies and their workforces in a range of sectors. Mutual integration of know-how in production chains could improve the global competitiveness of thousands of supplier companies. As you hear, I am using the subjunctive, because both your report this evening, Commissioner De Gucht, and important paragraphs in the EP resolution now before us make no offer of partnership; rather, they make unilateral demands to Japan. In my view, that is not a good starting point for long-term cooperation that brings mutual benefits. What we are discussing this evening is the mandate for the negotiations. I am in favour of a clear, frank and open-ended discussion of the differences between the EU and Japan around the negotiating table. A real partnership cannot be based on either side dictating terms. That is why, as a Group, we have problems with the text of the resolution. Let us have a look at it. There are large chunks of the text that appear to have been written by the car industry. At a time when we are facing a climate crisis, how can we seriously demand a commitment from the Japanese Government to abolish the special treatment for electric and hybrid vehicles and the concessions for micro vehicles such as Kei-Cars, just so that we can export more diesel-powered vehicles? The resolution’s over-emphasis on the abolition of non-tariff measures also conflicts with the findings of the Copenhagen study on trade between the EU and Japan. This study recognises that many of these measures help to improve general welfare, especially in the fields of health, the environment and consumer protection. We should therefore look at what the proposed arrangements are intended to achieve and seek an outcome which brings benefits to society but still promotes trade. Furthermore, companies surveyed have mentioned other reasons why they are deterred from investing in Japan. Above all, there is the language barrier, cultural differences, which also affect consumer preferences, high taxes and wage costs. Anyone who is reluctant to pay qualified translators, or to develop successful marketing strategies to promote their goods in Japan, or to pay local wages and taxes should invest at home instead. These types of trade barrier cannot and should not be removed by an agreement. In this context, the Committee on International Trade gained some very interesting insights last year into the strategy pursued by IKEA, a very large company that has tailored its operations to suit Japanese consumption patterns, culture and social standards. We need an agreement with non-tariff elements of cooperation. Joint programmes can bring together businesses and trade unions, consumer associations, academics, administrators and young people from Europe and Japan. Let us work towards a new culture of cooperation. That would also bring practical benefits for Europe’s SMEs in terms of energy efficiency and high-tech cooperation."}

I thank this House for sharing this view and for the continuous support for the common objective of eradicating violence against women and domestic violence. You have played a key role in keeping the EU’s accession to the Council of Europe Istanbul Convention high on the European political agenda for many years. The Commission welcomes the positive outcome of negotiations towards the conclusion of this Convention in both the Council and Parliament. The EU’s accession will reinforce the Union’s legal framework and send a strong message to all victims of violence against women and domestic violence on the importance of women’s rights in the EU. We need to combat violence against women on a common basis and ensure all women across Europe receive the same rights, support and protection. To date, protection for women at risk of violence and their access to support services vary between the different Member States. The EU’s accession to the Istanbul Convention will play a unifying role in raising awareness and promoting the exchange of good practices throughout the EU. The EU action provides an opportunity to contribute towards international progress in ending violence against women and be a global frontrunner on this topic. The EU accession will ensure the application of all relevant provisions of the Convention which fall under EU competence. We have already taken several policy and legislative measures which contribute to the implementation of the Convention at EU level. We have funding in place through the Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values programme, as well as legislation on trafficking in human beings and victims’ rights, to give some examples. The Commission has proposed a directive on combating violence against women and domestic violence, which aims at achieving the same objectives as the Istanbul Convention in the area of judicial cooperation in criminal matters. The proposed directive, once adopted by the co-legislators, will serve to implement the relevant parts of the Convention on prevention, protection, access to justice, and policy coordination and cooperation. We will be putting forward recommendations on combating harmful practices. We are setting up a network of gender-based violence experts. The finalisation of the EU accession process is another step in the direction of eradicating violence against women."}

She was killed while reporting in the West Bank. I’m as shocked and dismayed as you are, and I’m not sure what shocks me most – her death or the utter disrespect by Israeli police at her funeral, which I strongly condemn. Forty—two Palestinian journalists have been killed in 2022. To get the facts straight, it is clear that we need an independent inquiry into the killing of Shireen, and we need to do better to protect journalists both within and outside our Union. Media freedom is a cornerstone of our democracy. But colleagues, apart from the shock, I’m also angry – angry about the fact that too often we here in Europe look away when the spiral of violence continues, when new settlements plans are announced, or when another journalist gets killed or wounded. We all agree that we must tackle the root causes of this conflict. So let’s get to work and play our role. Shireen was called ‘the voice of Palestine’. Let us now commit to be the voice of Shireen. We have neglected the conflict too long. We must put new energy into bringing lasting peace between Israel and Palestine."}

I will inform you of those. These matters can be further explored by the groups in the debate with the Danish Presidency. One is an agreement in principle that by the end of January we shall have worked our way through the procedures for the appointment of the 10 new Commissioners from the accession states, and for the appointment of the new Commission following the departure of the Prodi Commission. Work is already in hand regarding this matter. A number of suggestions were put forward by committees and groups, but we must close this process by the end of January. I would like to point out to the groups that by that time we need to bring closure to the calendar for the year 2004 on the issues of the appointment of the Commission, dates of election and our own internal procedures. Secondly, we have an indication that there has been considerable progress – for which I thank colleagues – on drawing up an interinstitutional agreement on better regulation and law-making. We have a commitment in principle across the institutions to try to bring closure to this matter before the spring summit meeting in Brussels. We have several months to work through the remaining issues before the deadline. I put the groups and various committees involved in this matter on notice in respect of that. Thirdly, a conclusion was reached that the European Convention should draw up its own final report in time for the European Council meeting at Thessaloniki. Again, in anticipating our work into the next calendar year, we need to bring forward, on time, any proposals we have on substance and timing to try to influence what happens then and in the period after that. With regard to the Prestige, I noted that Parliament would seek to give as much urgency as possible to the question of financial solidarity and urge the Commission to bring forward specific proposals to the House. I also pointed out that we would treat such proposals with appropriate urgency when the matter is presented to us. Finally, on human rights issues, I placed considerable emphasis on the dialogue with Russia on the question of human rights in Chechnya. My speech is available and the groups may wish, on institutional points in particular, to raise some of these issues in the course of our debate with the Council."}

We represent the citizens and the residents of the European Union to advance their needs, and we cannot do it if we are strictly limited by belonging to the Group.

We managed to reach agreement following a lot of hard but constructive work, including some very difficult compromises. To put this debate into its proper context, over 9 million tonnes of electrical and electronic equipment is sold every year in the European Union. Most of this is large household appliances and IT and telecommunication equipment. As this market continues to grow, it has also become the fastest-growing waste stream in the EU, estimated to rise to a huge 12.3 million tonnes by 2020. It is a very complex waste stream that includes several hazardous substances. The waste hierarchy makes prevention of waste the first priority, which means substituting hazardous substances in products which prevent recycling or pose a risk to health and the environment when undergoing waste treatment. The Commission estimates that the current RoHS Directive has led to a reduction of 100 000 tonnes of certain heavy metals and two groups of brominated flame retardants from going into the waste stream and potentially entering the environment. RoHS has set a global standard, but there was a need for more clarity, so we had a great responsibility with this recast to ensure that a clearer and more ambitious law was adopted. I believe that we have improved the current directive in a number of ways. It now has a clear methodology, with criteria for deciding on new restrictions, complementary to and independent of REACH. The scope has been extended to include all electrical and electronic equipment within eight years, unless it is specifically excluded. There will be a review for additional exclusions within three years, together with an examination of three phthalates and one brominated flame retardant identified as priority. Time-limited exemptions can be granted on the basis of clear criteria and application deadlines. Nanomaterials will be looked at specifically in future reviews of restrictions. Given my ambitions for this report, Members will not be surprised that I am not completely satisfied with the final outcome. The RoHS Directive was designed to address the specific problems of a specific waste stream and I think that we have missed an opportunity to move it forward substantially by adding further restrictions. However, we have kept its identity and strengthened the Commission proposal in many ways. On correlation tables, my group supports making this obligatory for Member States, but this is a horizontal issue that affects all European legislation and cannot be resolved in this one file. To help find a solution, I proposed in Amendment 105 that we adopt a declaration calling on the Commission to report on the current practice of Member States in providing correlation tables and how it affects the Commission’s work instead of insisting on mandatory correlation tables. This will give us a much clearer picture for the future debate. In summary, we managed to strengthen a rather vague and unambitious proposal into a new RoHS which will deliver a higher level of protection for human health and the environment now and in the near future."}

The Commission shares many of the concerns expressed here today about Ukraine and its reform path. Ukraine has made a lot of progress, but progress has also been uneven across areas, and a lot remains to be done in order to make reforms irreversible. This is precisely why the MFA is so important. It is an instrument for the EU to support reform-minded forces in Ukraine and to continue to exercise EU leverage so that the still strong vested interests can be overcome. As I said during my opening remarks, if we turn our back on Ukraine, the risk of reform reversals could be high, and a lot of the achievements that Ukraine has without doubt made since 2014 would be at risk. Our message to Ukraine through this decision and the joint statement is crystal clear: solidarity goes hand in hand with a call for taking forward the reform drive with renewed vigour. One cannot go without the other. The EU committed to stand with the people of Ukraine. We cannot let Ukraine down and we cannot allow Ukraine to fail. Therefore, I count on your support tomorrow for the decision to grant further macro-financial assistance to Ukraine without further amendments."}
{"id": "c03a87df-511a-4600-a645-ba959c22ba9a", "text": "Madam President, honourable Members, good afternoon. Pollution is a major pressure on water and biodiversity. It affects life in rivers, lakes and seas, and our ability to use this resource for drinking water or irrigation. As droughts become more common, we cannot afford to pollute the waters that remain. This debate on a key deliverable in the zero-pollution package is therefore very timely. Many of these issues can be addressed through more integrated water management and by revising the list of water pollutants and modernising their quality standards. Let me start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Brglez, who has led a very inclusive discussion together with rapporteurs of the AGRI and ITRE Committees and this approach has secured very broad support in the ENVI Committee. And such a strong backing reflects the very high concern that the European Parliament continues to show for water, as also witnessed in the plenary discussion on the water crisis in June. You have my sincere gratitude and respect for this stance. I very much welcome this supportive and ambitious report. The proposal is based on the latest scientific knowledge, including advice from the Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks. It is the result of the extensive work with stakeholders and experts from the Member States who looked closely at which pollutants to include and the appropriate quality standards. In the face of new emerging threats and compelling toxicity evidence, we propose an expansion of the list of pollutants. A group of PFAs and other industrial substances, pesticides and pharmaceuticals have been included. Standards for some pollutants already listed have been tightened. For a few others, where science shows they are now less of a problem, standards should be relaxed. We know a lot about pollution, but in some cases not enough. And this is why we have strengthened the watch list mechanism with a preparedness system to generate better data, enabling us to act swiftly if the need arises. The proposal aims to reap all the benefits of digitalisation. It also strengthens transboundary cooperation when a pollution event affects several Member States. And this is very much needed, as we saw from the disaster in the Oder. The report presented here today proposes changes to the list of pollutants and standards, and there are suggestions for tighter deadlines and for no limits to the number of substances to be added to the watch list. Additional proposals include exploring extended producer responsibility, cost sharing for additional monitoring and the possibility of an EU water quality monitoring facility. While the general thrust here is very much in line with the Commission proposal, for some we will need to consider the practical feasibility and implementations. On the use of delegated acts, I would highlight the phrase ‘swift response’. I request your support to empower the Commission to introduce changes to the list and to quality standards for water pollutants more quickly. We need a more dynamic decision-making system to protect the environment and human health from emerging risks. Rest assured, this procedure will not lessen the necessary consultation of all parties. As for the report’s proposal on specific substances and standards, we acknowledge that some standards need to be corrected in light of the scientific committee’s final opinion. They will also be discussed with the Council. I’ll finish here. Thank you. And, of course, I look forward to the debate."}

Today I fulfil also my commitment that I gave you during the hearing one and a half year ago. This updated directive makes the EU more attractive for talents from abroad and, therefore, makes the European Union more competitive on the global scale. I would like to express my thanks, in particular, to Ms Wikström and the shadow rapporteurs, who have done a fantastic job. Thanks to your excellent work we have managed to keep a really ambitious text. The conclusion of the negotiations is important for several reasons. Firstly, we have clearly improved the immigration rules for students and researchers. Their rights are now more clearly defined. Secondly, intra-EU mobility rules have been improved so that knowledge and skills can circulate more freely within the European Union. Thirdly, students can now work a minimum of 15 instead of 10 hours per week, which means they contribute more to our economy and they can also be financially more independent. With the new instrument, graduates and researchers have a right to look for a job or to set up a business once they have finished their studies or research. Finally, we now also have binding EU-wide rules for trainees and volunteers within the European Voluntary Service. In parallel, for the first time we will also have common rules for third—country national au pairs, though only optionally. Let me also underline that the agreement sends out important messages in these challenging times. First of all, we welcome talent from outside of the European Union to come to us to study, carry out research, learn or volunteer. Those who would like to stay longer to work or to create a business are invited to do so. Equally importantly, we show that the EU sticks to its commitments to improve legal migration routes. Understandably, a lot of focus is now on the refugee crisis and people seeking protection. But migration is not just about asylum. It is also about mobility and empowerment, and facilitating that through legal channels. This is an important part of our overall migration policy and we deliver, as promised. Overall, could we have done better? Yes, there is almost always room for improvement. The Commission, together with this Parliament, has insisted throughout the negotiations that Member States’ discretionary powers with regard to rejecting an application may only be used when strictly necessary and, of course, justified. We made it clear in our joint statement to the political compromise that such discretionary power by the Member States should only be used on a case-by-case basis. It should take into account the specific circumstances of the third—country national and the principle of proportionality, and on the basis of evidence or serious and objective reasons. I can reiterate that the Commission will ensure that Member States implement this provision in line with this interpretation when transposing the directive and will inform Parliament and the Council thereof. Today Europe attracts 45% of international students worldwide but the international higher education landscape is changing rapidly. Such students and researchers are an asset and a contribution and I welcome the agreement on the revised EU rules to facilitate that contribution even more."}

I welcome the fact that we achieved a consensus on the need for European structural reform of the banking sector. It is clear that we need a European framework which mitigates the potential fragmentation of European financial markets as a result of Member States introducing their own banking reform laws, including the UK, France, Germany and possibly Belgium and the Netherlands. Our proposals of course do not go into the detail of how structural reform should be implemented but instead provide several key principles to feed into the Commission consultation process, which finishes on 11 July, and the forthcoming legislative proposal. Of course, the key objective of banking reform must be to deliver a safe, stable, effective and efficient banking system that operates in a competitive market economy and serves the needs of the real economy and of customers and consumers. Structural reform must stimulate economic growth – much needed growth in fact – by supporting the provision of credit to the economy, in particular to SMEs and start-ups; it must provide greater resilience against potential financial crises; it must restore trust and confidence in banks, which continue to be low. As the Commissioner said, a recent survey found that 86% of the public believe that it will be at least five years before they trust a bank again. Structural reform should remove risk to public finances caused by banks being too big to fail and deliver a change in banking culture which too often is dominated by excessive risk-taking in the pursuit of profits. Our reform principles focus therefore on reducing excessive risk, ensuring competition, reducing complexity and limiting interconnectedness in EU banks by separating banking activities that are essential for the real economy from risky trading and investment activities, ensuring the essential retail activities continue uninterrupted by problems caused by the investment arm, ensuring that risky trading activities do not benefit from implicit guarantees or subsidies or the use of insured deposits or tax payer bailouts, by ensuring those activities bear the risk and costs of the activities. To those critics of reform who claim we are breaking up the universal banking model I would respond that nowhere in this report or in the High-Level Group report is there any proposal for a ban on banks carrying out any activities in investment services, market making or underwriting. Corporates will still have access to services provided by universal banks. What we are arguing for is a structured and responsible universal banking model to ensure banks deliver funding to the real economy. Of course banking will always have risks, but ultimately those risks have to be borne and in a free and fair market economy they should not be borne by the taxpayer providing a very generous safety net. Retail customers have no alternatives to their high street banks for access to essential payment, deposit and credit services and I would argue as legislators we have an overriding economic, social and political imperative to avoid disruption to the continuing provision of those services. Structural reform through separation therefore must be a part of the reform process. Of course I would have wanted a more ambitious reform of banking structures. I would have wanted to enable full and legal separation where necessary, to make the socially vital part safer but ultimately this reform debate is more than the question of tackling the complexity of retail investment structures. It is also about the broader reforms of the culture of compensation around bonuses, it is about injecting competition into the banking system, it is about ensuring lending for growth, giving consumers the right to switch accounts. I am satisfied that this report now gives the green light to the Commission to come forward with a legislative proposal and it does indeed demonstrate that Parliament supports the need for an EU framework for structural reform and as such I am grateful to my shadows and colleagues for supporting this report in tomorrow’s vote."}

The collection of this data – on public private partnerships, debts of public corporations and government guarantees – will be institutionalised while excessive deficit questionnaires with annual, monthly and quarterly data will be available in 2014. Data on pensions will be available in accordance with the provisions of the draft ESA Regulation – with this being optional for 2012 and compulsory starting from 2015 – on a three-year basis and, finally, the Commission is ready to present a report to the ECON Committee, upon request. It was also said that this is maybe a dull file. I was myself for many years a member of the Governing Board of the Statistical Office of Slovenia – by the way, my PhD was based on social national accounts – and I have probably heard ESA 95 mentioned as many times as anybody here. I can only say that no important and substantial decisions are possible without hard statistical work and long methodological discussions, and I have learnt that the ESA is a kind of statistical bible. So in moving from ESA 95 to ESA 2010 we are taking an extremely important decision. We are bringing stability to the statistical system on the one hand but, on the other hand, we are bringing in new elements through new knowledge and, of course, also new times.

It is for that reason that EUR 11 billion has been committed in the next multiannual financial framework to the EU’s space programmes, be it Galileo, Copernicus or space research. A considerable amount of this money will be devoted to space activities. It is therefore essential to ensure the most efficient possible use of such investment. Good coordination among our stakeholders is essential: Member States, the Commission, the Space Agency and others. It is also essential that we ensure coherence in the programmes and avoid duplication in spending and structures. A reflection along these lines is already underway following the recent Commission communication on establishing appropriate relations between the EU and the European Space Agency. Ms Nieblerʼs report is also right in stressing the need for Europe to seek technological non-dependence and develop the critical technology to pursue its space ambition and maintain a competitive position in the world. It is at this global level where we need also to be very careful. The Commission is doing that, not only in the context of the ongoing EU-US transatlantic trade partnership negotiations but also for the long term by way of a study which will be issued in the second half of next year. Finally, the rapporteur advances the role of the private commercial market for the European space industry and the importance of the satellite communications sector.

From the viewpoint of the Subcommittee on Human Rights, I would like to stress that democracy and human rights belong inseparably together. This is patently obvious from the different definitions of democracy that exist, and I would like to draw your attention to the fact, for example, that the United Nations attempted to define democracy in 2005. The definition contains a long list of items, from a pluralist political system to the rule of law, transparency of government, freedom of the media, and so on. This clearly shows us that human rights cannot be divorced from democracy. If it wants to use them, the European Union has a very wide range of resources at its disposal to promote democracy in the world. The entire development policy and the Common Foreign and Security Policy cover this whole spectrum. The resources available to us are dialogue with other countries, various financial instruments, involvement in international forums and election observation, which are obviously very important to us. There are also situations where we have to think about various negative measures. I would like to bring to Minister Malmström’s attention the fact that next week, the General Affairs and External Relations Council is preparing to discuss the revocation of the ban on the exporting of weapons to Uzbekistan. I think that everything indicates that this is quite the wrong signal to send, as Uzbekistan has not really listened to the demands of the international community. The international community, including the European Union, requested it to conduct an independent, international investigation into the tragic and shocking events in the spring of 2005 in Andizhan, when democracy was well and truly suppressed. I would also like to hear what Minister Malmström thinks about this situation. How can we promote democracy when some Member States now want to end this ban on the exporting of weapons? I would also like to say that democracy cannot be exported. It is no product for export. It does not really work as something brought in from the outside, and that is why I would like to emphasise the importance of including civil society in the process, because that way, democracy grows organically, as it were: from the grassroots of society. I would like to mention that Russia is a cooperation partner that systematically refuses to agree to the involvement of NGOs in dialogues on human rights between it and the Union. In my view, we cannot accept this situation in the future. Finally, I would like to say that support for democracy should be higher up the agenda in the Union’s foreign and security policy and development policy. It also needs more resources. For example, the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights is very modestly resourced and we should increase its funding."}

I think for Jean—Claude Juncker, it is his fifth or sixth. Let us be honest: as I said a few times to Commissioner Oettinger, it will be business as usual in this MFF. It can still be business as usual because this proposal has to go to the Council and it is there that it is business as usual: trying to get the maximum amount of money from the budget without paying a lot into that budget. Personally, I think that this MFF is a break with the past. It’s not a revolution, but it’s a break with the past on four elements. The first is that we had two decades of MFFs and budgets being reduced and, for the first time, we are going up again. We went down to 1% and we are going up to 1.14%. It’s not a revolution, but it’s on the right track. The second is the priorities. For the first time, I see serious cuts where they are necessary and new money where it is necessary: innovation, research, Erasmus. Border management will increase a lot, to a total of EUR 34 billion over the seven—year period. I see a third break with the past: finally, new own resources – a battle that started 10 years ago.

I think there have been good proposals on carbon taxation, plastics, corporate tax, and there is Mr Bullmann’s proposal that you can take with you. Lastly, I think the fourth break with the past is the conditionality in the budget – respect for the rule of law. We have to be very clear about this, Commissioner. It is also very simple, colleagues. If a government of a Member State of the European Union wants to apply and to respect European values, they do not need European money to do that. That’s the reality that we need to include in this budget. European money, in my opinion, should be used to lift up our national economies, to lift up our citizens and not be given or be granted to Mr Orban’s family or to finance one or more new football stadiums in his constituency. That is not a reason for spending the money. Finally, I think that we are taking a huge step forward and my request to you is to help us to take the last step forward. That is in the power of Parliament. We always receive beautiful speeches here from the Heads of State and Government. Tomorrow we will have another one from my Prime Minister, and we will have another within a few weeks. They all talk about the virtue of European democracy, but in reality this is the only parliament worldwide which has no say about its income. We only have a say about expenditure. That has to change now. In my opinion, Mr Commissioner, there will be no green light from this Parliament for whatever deal you make with the Council if there is no principle agreement with the Council that gives full responsibility for expenditure and income to the Council and to Parliament. Mr Juncker, we count on your support because the Council will be stubborn on this issue – we know that. They think, ‘it is all money and we decide on it’. No, it is more and more money from companies and citizens, and it’s our own resources. Who represents the companies and the citizens? We, the European Parliament, represent them. I count on your full support to help us to obtain that responsibility and then to get the green light for this more ambitious MFF."}

All of this makes Europe stronger and safer and we have, just two weeks ago here in the plenary of Parliament, voted the budget of the European Union for next year, which also gives predictability to the beneficiaries of EU funds for next year. But we need to give predictability to those who expect European support in the long term, and this is why the first important topic of this Council will be the revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework. It was agreed in 2020. Since then, we had to do many things which we did not anticipate. The Commission was right to put forward a revision proposal of the Multiannual Financial Framework in June. We the Parliament have expressed our view, and we urge the Council to adopt its position on this revision at the Council meeting this week, so that early next year we can conclude the final negotiations between Parliament and the Council on this topic. Why is this important and what do we expect? This revision is important to provide support to Ukraine, to better protect our borders, to manage migration, to strengthen our economy and make it more competitive, and indeed to support Ukraine. This revision is also important to create reserves for unforeseen developments so that, if anything unexpected happens until 2027, the Union can support people in case of need. This is the first important topic of the Council. The second one is indeed enlargement. Let me be clear: what Ukraine needs from us now is those concrete tools that help it win the war on the ground, the military support. But the financial support is also important. I was in Washington last week. The EUR 50 billion that the European Union will put forward for Ukraine will be essential to mobilise international, including US support. We cannot expect other regions of the world to support Ukraine financially and militarily unless we are there in the front line and support ourselves. Last point: the accession talks. No one is talking now about the immediate accession of Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova to the European Union, but what is important is that these negotiations start. Why is this important? Because the accession negotiations are the best tool that we, as the European Union, have to make our neighbouring countries safer and more stable, to help them reform, modernise and get closer to European standards, as well as adapt to and implement European legislation. This is why these accession negotiations are not only in the interests of our neighbouring countries, but they are in the interest of the European Union as a whole. This is the view of Parliament, of the majority of its Members. We hope the Council can unanimously make this decision this week."}

In reality, the first year has shown that the European Parliament has had to fight with the Council and the Commission simply to achieve parliamentary codecision and democratic control. The codecision of Parliament on all budgetary questions is a democratic minimum standard. I repeat: it is a minimum standard. This Parliament was elected to bring the European ideal to life and to act as a counterbalance to national egotism. It is our duty not to compromise which it comes to the involvement of the European Parliament in the negotiations concerning the financial framework for the 2013 to 2020 budgets. New tasks cannot be financed by budget reallocations, or at least only to a very limited extent. When faced by the tight budgets in the Member States, it is completely incomprehensible that the Council is refusing to discuss the own resources with Parliament. The European budget must be a concrete representation of the solidarity of the Member States. Otherwise, we will move away from the fundamental idea of European integration and lose the respect of the citizens of Europe. The net contributors seem to have forgotten this. While their companies are making profits on the European internal market, Germany and other countries are being thoroughly miserly when it comes to overcoming the joint challenges faced by Europe. Solidarity has been redefined and one Member State will only help the others when this is to its own advantage. The German banks are so deeply enmeshed in the crisis in the Irish financial sector that the lifeline is just as important for the rescuers as it is for those being rescued. In recent years, my group has rejected the EU budget. We believe that its priorities are wrong and that too little attention has been paid to overcoming the decline in environmental and social prosperity. This has deepened the social divide within the EU and within the Member States. It is totally unacceptable for major projects such as ITER to be financed at the expense of projects which provide direct funding for students, the unemployed, rural areas and local communities. To summarise, it is high time, and I admit this is a somewhat simplistic way of putting it, for us to think more closely about the people of Europe in European terms and not in egotistic national terms."}

Things like mediation get results that are at least as good, if not actually better than anything that would come out of a court process. And given the huge issues facing, for example, Ireland’s family law system, including the massive problems with concepts such as parental alienation creeping into it and being put forward by court experts who aren’t experts, it really would be better if we were to support available and robust and effective mediation processes. I come from a country with some of the highest legal costs in Europe. They are at levels which have been criticised consistently in the EU rule of law reports as being a barrier to justice. That means that alternative dispute resolution is often people’s only option and if that’s not available, then they’re out of options. So I’m really glad to see it being put centre stage in this report."}
